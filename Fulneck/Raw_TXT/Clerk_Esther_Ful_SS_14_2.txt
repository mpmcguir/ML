Memoirs of the late happily departed Sister
Esther Cleake who on the 27th of May 1791
at Fulneck enterd into the joy of her Lord
In the 76th Year of her age.
She has left the following account concerning
her Pilgrimage here below.
I think my dear Brethren & Sisters will
like to hear somthing of my Course through
this time which I will gladly relate to the
honour of my dearest Saviour. I was Born at
Kirton in Lincolnshire, July 8th 1715 my Parents died when
I was very young, was therefore left an Orphan
to Providence, or to my dear Creator & Saviour
for whom I was born & destined surely.
To tell my dear Brethrening & Sisters of the
Goodness, the mercy & kindness, the love & faithfulness
of My dear Lord & Saviour to me a poor Child.
my weak words fall very short to express the
praise that is due to him, from me, for his wonders
have been without end, thanks, thousand thanks
be to the Lamb for ever & ever. I will now relate
some of the particulars of the tender lendings of
My gracious & most faithfull Lord. The first
impression of grace I remember, was when I was
about four Years old, when one day kneeling by
a choir with a book in my hand, in which was those
words, Seek and ye shall find knock, & it shall


shall be append unto You, I felt somthing
particular at the time, I had a very quick under
standing for my years, and a very sensible feeling
of what was right, and wrong I wanted to be a good
Child that I might go to Heaven, on that account
I was much praised, which wou'd have been more
hurtfull to me, but the dear Holy Ghost who had 
begun his work in my heart, pleased me continualy, my
wicked and sinfull nature, which kept me low &
consions that I did not deserve that praise, which
was a grace to me at that time, so it checked my
Satanick pride, which I felt very sensible, Yet 
from many circumstances I thought God must
love me, but how it was I cou'd not tell, I have
I was a sinner, In my 11th year I was very thought
full and distress'd, felt guilt with the impression
that I did not love God, nor cou'd I promise him
which one day a little bird was made use of to 
shew me that I cou'd not praise my Creator even
as a Bird cou'd I had also strange Idea's about
him, what kind of a form he had, and was much
perplexed about it at this time I had a dream where
in I thought God allmighty was in a parlour in 
the house where I was, and that he was a Man of
which I was very glad, & thought then One cou'd be
familliar with him. But not understanding the 
gracious lending of my dear Saviour, I continued
extremly


extremly distress'd, thought I commited Sin
evry moment by the strange thoughts I had, &
they was of such a nature, I cou'd not tell them
to any body, nor wou'd they have understood me,
but wearied indeed with trying to help myself
a thought came in my mind, As I can not help
these thoughts God Almighty has nothing
against me. In that moment my mercifull
and compassinate Saviour drew near with his
love and gave me peace, it was as If he said to
me, I have nothing against thee, I was amazed
but did not know how to account for it, to be
loved by God in such a manner, from that time
When those thoughts came again I cou'd believe
he had nothing against me for it, but not under
standing the right poor Sinners path I came into
an esteem self rightious course, Striveing with
all my might to be good by other means then
Jesus blood, I fasted & prayd, wanting to be as
good as the Primitive Christians, not likeing any
one to be better then myself, here my Satanick
pride show'd itself to a great degree, All how
unwilling was I to be saved by grace I went on
for some time in this manner. My Aunt dieing who
brought me up, I became a Second time an Orphan
indeed She treated me as If She had known my
destination. Ah the wonders of My dear Saviours
love which I did not then understand through


His kind providence in My 19th year I went
to London into Lady Scarborough's Family.
who had sent for me to wait on her little Neice
and My dear Saviour put it into her heart from the first
moment to be remarkable kind to me, and the whole
family shew'd a great regard & respect for my religious
turn of mind, which they found was sincere
(not on account of outward gifts or quatifications)
but the dear Holy Ghost in whose School I then
was, gave me a constant sence of My depraved
nature in all it shapes, and finding I fell so far
short of what I thought I shou'd be, this kept
me low and in some sence humble, and kept the
ballance against that hartfull prais which is
often given. I served also in several other families
namely Lord Orrory, Lady Charlott Edan's &
the Duke of Buckclugh. My dear Saviour
and most faithfull Shepherd helped me through
with all my imperfections so wonderfully
that If I may humbly say so, I found favour
with God, & Man, but I nor no body else, thought
what was prepareing for me. In my 26th year I
return'd to Lady Scarborough who always received
me with the greatest kindness, At this time I fell
again into self working fasted & prayed much, till I 
was quite weared finding it did me no good, Once in
the Year 42 while at prayer I felt somthing very
blessed, it was quick like the fleeting of a Star


but it seemed to me all that was good, it was
Light Peace, Joy, all happiness in One moment
I thought it was the Holy Spirit, & praied to
feel more of it. Soon after I received a letter
concerning the preaching of the Methodists which
I had never heard of. I was very much biggote to
the Church & thought it a shame to go any where else
I thought how ever I wou'd inquire about them what
kind of people they wear, it happend at this time a
Methodist came in My way, and by his conversation
I was convinced of what I wanted, the knowledge of the
atonement of our Saviour for My Sins, then all his
gracious leading was brought to my mind so that I
knew it was a faith from God, the person lent me
a Sermon book of Sermons of Mr Whitfields
the more I read the more it was opened to me that
I wanted a Saviour, for my mind took a turn and
I found some rest from my labour, and saw that it
was Christs rightousness that I wanted, I enterd
with my whole mind into the matter, got all the
books I cou'd of that kind amongst the rest I got
the Brethrens little Hymn book which sat'd me
exceedingly well espicialy One Verse, viz: If I
glimse in My own breast Feel of a Christian bliss
Then on the truth of it let me rest. That such a
Life there is. At length my good Lady found I had
got Methodist books, but did not think I was so deep
in the matter, for She had a better opinion of me
then that I wou'd follow such people, but one time


being with her at Court, She caught me reading a
letter which she took from me, wherein She found I
had been Once at the Tabernacle, She was much
concern'd & took the greatest pain possible to diss
waid me from it, but I was Devinly convinced of
the truth of the Gospel, my Lady forbid me to go
to the Tabernacle, I told her I cou'd wou'd not with
out leting her Ladyship know, I thought I cou'd do
with books & Stay at Home, at this time the family
went into the Country, where was a good friend a
Minister who took great pain to prevent my
going too deep in my present Ideas, he brought me
many books but to no purpose, my heart was afraid
of the truth, We return'd to London and I grew very
uneasy, found I cou'd not be faithful without
going to hear the preaching, I therefore desired
leave, which was not granted. My good Lady was
now very much distress'd about me, She wanted
to keep me, & out of Love & kindness she did her
 what She cou'd to perswaid me, She wanted
me again to be advis'd by some Minsters,
I chose the Bishop of Oxford (Sacher) for that
purpose I was so clear in My matter I feared no
thing, my Br went with me to the Bishop and
accused me of leaving the Church, I told him
it was because they did not preach our Saviours
Sufferings, & I was fully asured nothing else


cou'd save me, this he aprov'd of, as to good work
I said, when the tree is good, the fruit will be good,
he was very tender with me finding I was Sincere
If it was possible I was more confirm'd in my point
then before, My dear Lady was much dissapointed
but I cou'd not help it, here She rested, she had
done all She cou'd but My matter remained to leave
her, or have leave to to go to the preachings, at last
I con'd do no longer, therefore went to hear the
preaching, I was wanted before I came home again,
My Lady ask'd me where I had been, I told her, She
said I had gone without leave, I said because her
Ladyship wou'd not have given the leave If I had
ask'd upon this She sent me out of the room
to see me no more, She was affraid to keep me on
account of the Children & Servants, least I shou'd
bring them into my way of thinking, & when I went
with her to Court it was a shame at that time to be
a Methodest. But My dear Saviour had prepared
my way for me, I went to bed as composed as if
nothing had happened, In the morning I rose with
great chearfulness, like a Bird releas'd from a
Cage, and agent to the Tabernacle at 6 o'Clock from
Cavendish Square, which was a wonder of God for I
had nothing, nor any prospect how I shou'd get my
bread, had very little money, many hard things was
set before me, and in myself nothing to depend on, nor
had I any acquaintance here, Our dear Saviours


words became litterally true, seek first the
Kingdom of God & its Righteousness and all things
shall be added unto You, I was like a Child
turn'd out of doors (was again an Orphan) But
my ever faithfull Lord whose Hand & Eye was over
me cared for me in evry respect. My Lady gave me
proof more of her kindness to me, finding I had
no acquaintance, sent me word that I shou'd lodge
there till I cou'd find a home the Servants was
amaized at me, because I was otherwise no person
of courage, but they did not know that I had found
the Pearl of great price. I stay'd with my Brother
in the day time till the preaching time at the
Tabernacle, my Brother was very shy to me, he was
sorry for My leaving such a good place. He look'd
into my books, made a good observation & said all
professions make the Scriptures there rule, but
If this inward feeling can be true it must come from
God. It pleased he to hear him say so much.
I enquir'd of him for the Brethrens Chapel that I 
might see the people to whom by little Hymn Book
belong'd (this was in Feby 1744) He directed me
but when I came to Fetter Lane there was no preaching,
I enquir'd at the Chapel House Sr Wheeler kindly
ask'd me to come in Shewed me the Chapel, and what
She told the at that time of Our Saviour walking
amongst his People, made such an impression on


me that I never shall forget. It Tallied with my own
experience, I enquired if the Countes of Zinzendorf
did not want a Servant, but heard She was not in England.
I went to Speak with Mr Whitfield to advise with
him, and found him at Br John Syms's, I told them my
case just as it was, Sr Syms according to her kind way
in such cases took me into her house, thus I left my
good Lady & all my old Friends, with greatfull
thanks for all their kindness & I heartly pray that
My dear Lady May not loose her reward, I cou'd do no
other but follow my gracious Lord and Saviour, Br &
Sr Syms Shewed me great kindness, Mr Whitfield &
his Wife was also very kind to me, but Mr Whitfield
going to George in about six weeks, this connexion
was ended. Br & Sr Syms being atach'd to the Brn
I often went with them to Fetterlane, I had receive'd
many blessings by going to the Tabernacle, at this
time Br & Sr Syms moved, from which time I left off
going to the Taber. Now my good Lord led me Step
by Step as it pleased him both inwardly & outwardly
in a most gracious manner which brings these lines
to my mind. With patience immense, And love so
intense, He hath led me on, I'm lost in amazment
When thinking thereon. Now being come to my proper
home, the dear Congn where I have enjoy'd more blessings
then I am able to express, they have been so many, and so
great, and my call to the dear Congn is so clear and weighty
to me, that I can say, next to our Saviour, the Congn is the


dearest thing to me, I am a Sinner to whom belongs
nothing but shame & confusion of face, but it has
pleased him to open to me the treasure of his Love
& great Salvation, which has been sealed to me by
his Spirit, by his Word, by his Congn as an eternal truth
for such was my make that I must know it as a truth
for myself, was truly convinced of unbeliefs, and my
enmity against our Saviour, when this came to the
highest pitch, I thought If there was another Saviour
I wou'd have him, I felt condemned for the thought
and in that moment I was overpowerd with the
love and peace of my dear Saviour, and as If he
said to me for all this I love thee. The feeling
and impression of his nearness, bow'd me down in
the dust before my gracious Lord, with this
Sensation, The poor Sinners happy feeling, the holy
shame. But My selfrighteousness still
troubled me in various shapes, but in that feeling
the following verse was sealed to me as the greatest
truth, O precious precious blood, The only Holiness
that's good, Still drop, & flow & cover me, it
cursed Sinner without thee. The Scripture, the
preachings, the Hymns, where open'd with such
truth & Life which I can't describe.
I left Br & Sr Syms with greatfull thanks for
all their care, and went to live with Mr Delamott
at Black Heath to take care of Betsey Holand
her Parents being gone to Germany, here I experienc'd


something particular in the first place to my shame.
I was shewn such love and respect from this dear
family, but what relates particularly to the heart
was as I have said the preachings had been so blessed
to me, being now all at once taken from all meetings,
which I felt much store by, it was amazing to me
that I now enjoy'd such a Sabatic stillness & a
Sunshine of peace for that time, that I wanted
nothing, but was indeed as a Child at the breast.
I was not Yet in the Congn tho' I had defer'd it some
time. Br & Sr Holand how comeing from Germany
I went with their Daughter to live with them.
I now thought much about being received into the
Congn, but I had still to wait some time, which
was very wholsome for the I was once much comforted
by these words, Jesus thy affairs will think on,
as thy ever loveing Head. At length the hour which
certainly at the right moment, the Divine impression
to me was, I am now in by Fathers House, this was
May 18th 1747, and the 2d of Sept following I had
the unspeakable grace to be a partaker of my dear
Saviours body & blood in the Holy Sacrament.
In this period ah! how good & blessd was the Liturgies
& all the Meeting to my poor heart beyond all expres
sion, I had the grace to feel that in myself I was
a poor Creature truely convinced no one worse, had a
solid feeling what Sin is in all its odious Shapes
I am sensible that I have given the dear Holy Ghost


to keep me low as a sinner, my dear Brn & Srs
will understand what that sensation is a solid
feeling what is sin, but not to touch sin God forbid
In this Year I went to live at Mile end with the
Children here I had new appearings of my dear Saviours
Love and grace especially relating to my Choir. I
was drawn to read the Canticles & these Disciples
of our Saviours love to his Church was opend to
me with such truth & reallity as I can't express
The following verse was much impressed on my mind
at this time, O thou the fairest of mankind
Thy beauty strike both heart & mind. But
nothing is so fair in thee. As thy sweet form
upon the tree and can thro' his love & grace say
Nothing has so struck me. As when God's
Spirit took me too Golgotha O God be prais'd
This has a period in the Congn of some extravegances
But can say for myself I am truly convinc'd
by my own experiance that there was a glory
from the Lord, indeed too great for earthly minds
long to bear, but I expect to see it again in
perfection without a Vail between, and with
the whole Sinners train surround that Cavity
where I shall dwell eternally, at this time
that verse was realised to my heart, To be
enamour'd I know well, To have the heart quite
overflowing, For him alone to be so glowing
Expressions only me here fail. About this


this time I also had a new school for my own heart
concerning the Virgin Station, and found that only
by partaking of the Nature of the only Virgin man
one cou'd deserve that Character, this was made
very clear to me, Fair gifts of my creation, quite
spirit'd made me disspair for this grace, the
knowledge of myself (in this particular) I adore &
thank my dear Lord & his Spirit for teaching me
the way to turn to his precious blood, which alone
can cleanse our hearts and make all good, I found
it an antidote against all those sins that stick
so close to our nature.
In the year 1751 I was sent to care for the Single
Srs in Ockbrook and in Sepr 1757 I receiv'd a call
to go to Tytherton for the same purpose, and arrived
there in the Angels ????, this Jurney I shall
never forget, it was very much bless'd to me through
the nearness of my gracious Lord, and the impression
I had of the aid of his dearAngels, July 19th 1763
I return'd again to Ockbrook, and Decr 11th 1772
I arrived in London where I hope to finish my poor
& insignificant labour, In all these places my
best Friend has help'd me through in wholesome
poverty both internally & externally, and I can
say with the Deciples, I have lacked nothing, have
been rich in the midst of poverty, here I desire
to give my due thanks to My dear Bretheren &


and Srs, and particularly those of My own Choir
for their love kindness & patience towards me.
But ah! how much is due to by dearest & best
Friend & lover, for his Election of grace & for the
knowledge of his dear Wounded Person, his precious
blood, and all what he is to me, I conclude with
the 30th verse of the 43d Chapter of Eccleasiastious
which well express my mind, When You Glorify the
Lord, exalt him as much as God can; for even Yet
will he far exceed; and when You exalt him, put forth
all Your Strength, and be not weary, for You can
never go for enough. Thus far our late Sisters account.
Having serv'd the Single Sisters Choirs with great
faithfulness, and blessing in several Congns (had the
confidence of her Sisters who always found in her a kind
and Sympathizing friend ready to share with them in
joy & smart, the prosperity of every One laying very
near her heart) till her bodily infirmities wou'd no
longer permit her to do what her heart & mind was
Still willing for June 20th 1782 She arrived here
in Fulneck to injoy a Sabath. During the 8 years
of her abode here, She often express'd her gratitude
to our Saviour for his kind leadings of her through
this Vale of tears and that she had the favour to
enjoy her time of rest in this dear Congn. She had the
love and respect of ev'ry one that knew her we can with
truth give her this testimony that She approved


herself among us as a real Child of peace.
At our last Choir Festival She was present at all
the meetings, which was the last time she was able
to go out after which She lost her strength very
perceptably but her longing to be at home with her
dearst Lord encreased daily, two days before her
happy departure She said a Sr that was with
her with great emotion of heart, I go to our Saviour
as the greatest Sinner, not one so great as I am,
but this I can tell You, He has pardon'd all my
transgressions & clothed me in the robe of his
righteousness, on the 27th of May at 11 oClock
in the forenoon She desir'd to be helped up I see she said
our Saviour he to here, now he will soon fetch me,
after which she lay mostly Still, till 7 oClock
in the Evening when the long wish'd for moment
came, that She departed softly & happily into the 
joy of her Lord with the blessing of her Choir
in the 76th year of her Age.
