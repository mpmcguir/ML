When all thy mercies O my God
My rising soul surverys,
lost
Transported with the view I'm 
In wonder, love, and praise.
Looking back upon days which
are gone, a long life which
has passed away as a tale
which is told. -- What cause
do I find for deep humilia
tion and daring gratitude
to my gracious God and
Saviours who thro' all the 
changes, and chances of this
mortal life, has helped me
to this hour, and given
me a good hope through
grace; I would fain leave
a poor but grateful testimony


of his love, mercy, & forbearing
goodness to me, His poor
erring child In London I
first saw the light, 1783.
One of four, two only survived
My Father one of a numerous
family was early cast upon
the world to obtain his
own bread married early
My dear old Grandfather
I well remember, he had
at that time some situation
in the India House having
lost all his property hu-
manly speaking through
the carelessness of a female
servant. Being then in
good trade in Kent she
instead of cutting off a


candle she wanted, burns
it off and not taking
time to observe whether the
wick of the separated part
was extinguished, left it, it
is supposed still burning.
In the night a fire broke
out, & everything was consu
med, nothing being ensur
ed, all was lost  As soon as
they could came to London,
through whom he obtained
this situation I know
not, but that he appeared
to me a very dear old man
My Father was at this time
in the employ of the Right
able 
Hon I Sheridan a noted
political character, who
for his second wife married 


a Lady related to the late
Lady Elizabeth Whitbread
Mother of my beloved 
Mrs Waldegrave Part of this
lady's fortune was expended
to purchase an estate in
Surry to be settled upon
herself and children
While we were yet young my
Father undertook to be
land stewart on to be Bailiff
of this estate -- we all removed
to the country & dwelt in a 
pretty cottage on the borders
of a romantic common
Even now the remembrance
is sweet and I seem to sink at
the fragrance of the beautio
Moss roses in the little garden
before the house.


Yet there my precious time
was wasted there my false
views of life were nursed up
Our dear parents were strictly
moral we went to church
and learned catechisms
but of the depravity of human
nature I had no knowledge
of vital religion we might be
said to be almost as ignorant
as the heathen. I had
exalted ideas of what human
nature might be and aimed
with all my might to be what
I called good I read with
eagerness works of fiction loved
to dwell upon those characters
who were represented as
overcoming all difficulties
by their own generosity of 
heart and nobleness of mind 


I might spend much time in
enumerating the trouble this
caused me not finding man
whose ideas presumed as mine
and constantly failing to execut
all I intended to do I sighed
mourning turned back upon
myself-indulging a morbid
sensibility, finding no rest
for the sole of my foot. 
My gracious God and Saviour
in His love and mercy intend
that I should yet become
acquainted with His love
and mercy manifested
in the redemption of a
lost world. About this time
the lady of the mansion
haveing a dear little boy
now old enough to comment
at least learn A,b,c took a


fancy to me, requested to 
have me to care for this little
boy, promising to care for
me as her own. To the utmost
of her power she performed
this, but it would surprise
many, to hear of the straits to
which she was too often reduced,
by the thoughtless extravagance
of her husband having some
qualities she admired, my
selfrighteous delusions were
strengthened After a few
years upon the marriage
my 
of dear departed sister to
Mr Whitburn son of a substan
tial farmer of Ripley, a
neighbouring village, I retur
ned home. This match was
thought so good that there was 


much rejoicing but in a
few years came a sad reverse
my brother in law's affairs
became embarrassed and
alas! he concealed the em
barrassment from my sister
till the last moment, from
mistaken feelings of shame
and tenderness and thus
put it out of her power to help
to avert the impending ruin
His friends helped him but
a dealer in cattle he failed
to a large amount in the end
my sister and her two dear
boys returned to the parental
roof and Mr. Whitburn went
out to the Cape of Good Hope with
letters of recomendation from
the late lamented Mr Whit


bread the faithful friend 
of all whose cause he un
dertook, and I again left
home going to the sister 
in law of the lady whose little
boy I had cared for. This
lady travelled a great deal
and had some time before
offered to pay a person to
stay with my mother if
my Mother would spare me
which then she did not, but
now we think it providential,
we did. We saw a great deal
of the countty but grieving
over the troubles of my
family I enjoyed much
less than I might have
done; and at the end of 
two years thought myself 


highly favoured, when I 
heard that the eldest daugh
ter of Mr & the Lady Elizabeth
Whitbread was going to be mar
ried to the Hon Cap now
Earl of Waldegrave and
that the Lady Elizabeth wished
to present me to her daughter
the character of the lady I
greatly admired, what I
heard of the gentleman
prepared me to honour him
For the Lady Elizabeth and
Mr. Whitbread I felt an idol
sort of admiration they
had tried to aid my
brother in law and my
father, I felt grateful


and devoted myself en
thusiastically to their
daughter. In 1812 came
into Bedfordshire, after my
brother in law left England
we heard of his safe arrival
at the Cape-- of (letters) having
obtained a situation but
he had had two fits of
sickness was then going
some hundred miles up
the country, promising to send
remittances, but we heard
unsure and the constant
state of anxiety under
mined the health of my
beloved sister had some
wholesome regulations
being made at Somerset
House so that no person


could any longer hold a situa
tion in that office who did
not fulfuill the duties of it
in person obliged my father
who had longheld one
employing a deputy unless
he gave it up to remove his
family to London which
was a great pleasure to me
as we sometimes came to
London but at Cardington
I was treated with the great
est kindness and confidence
I went among the villagers
searching for and relieving 
their wants doing all I
could for them with the 
approbation of Cap & my
beloved Mrs Waldegrave
whose Aunt the lady St. John


being a member of the 
Brn Church invited me
and my friend Mrs Weir
to go to the chapel at Bedford
in the evening of Easter day 1813
we were pleased but no particu
lar impresion was made upon
either on the Easter Sunday
following Lady St John invited
me to the love feast I was
pleased and in the meantime
becoming more intimately
acquainted with Sr. Thomas
Smith late Sr Hannah Brown
resident at Cardington &
whose family had joined
the Brn my Knowledge
of the Brethren and attach
ment to them increased
often has she refreshed


my soul by accounts she
has brought of sermons &
meetings: and now my
Father being much embar
rassed by the derangement
of the affairs of the charaters
before alluded to, it was
but the prelude to a train
of sorrow more keenly
thy 
felt because in persons of
those near and dear to me.
In 1810 we lost our mother
and I driven by the departure
of from Cardington an
enlightened curate, often
accompanied the dear
family of our worthy
Br & Sr Brown to the 
Moravian Chapel finding
comfort and one Sabbath


morning Br Harke preached
when he gave out the Hymn
(in the old HB.) the true good
Shepherd God's own son when
he came to the 2nd verse For thee
He shed His precious blood 
and how His own doth claim
I was as it were transfixed
to my seat what I felt I 
can not describe then surely
the Lord gave me the first
intimation of His will in 
this matter yet tho deeply
impressed I heeded not
this intimation as I ought
to have done. Yet I was during
this time fervently praying
Lord thou hast blessed me
by these people bless me with
them I began to consider


how strong the claims which
my dear Mrs. Waldegrave
had upon me not only for
her kindness to me but
from the nurturing consider
ation with which she and
her honoured parents had
in every way endeavoured to
aid us in the troubles of
our family. I found too
that to attend to the Chappel
as I wished I could not fulfill
my duties to her and then
meeting with Newton's four
letters an apology for the 
Church of England. gave 
up going to Chapel - satisfied
myself with what I heard
at Church certainly believing
myself right as far as I then
??? in principle.


My beloved mother de
parted in May. The lamen
ted Mr. Whitbread in July
the same year - woe upon woe
for I took a near interest. My sister
my Mary came to see me - attended
business in Biggleswade - nothing
seemed to prosper her mind 
ultimately gave way under
accumulated trouble my
own received a shock which
only the Rock of Ages held from
shattering me. her youngest
boy obtained a presentation
to Christ Hospital his elder
brother went to sea under the
guidance of Captain Waldegrave
who after the death of Mr Whit
bread during the minority
of his son held the his seat
in parliment. On his coming 
of age and taking his seat


Cap Waldegrave took his family

days in France when we loss

of dysentry which was then

The dear little girl was ten
derly attached to me. I think


I could not have loved any
one more. The moment she was
dressed she left her home &
we generally passed our
time together sad was the
journey to me, after she left.
My mind constantly drawn
to Bedford, hoping to retreat
to the Srs house there, but detain
ed from mentioning my
desire, by a sense of obligation
to beloved Mrs. Waldegrave,
and the grief I knew it
would cause her, if we parted.
so there was the desire,
pent up in my own
bosom, and shaking.
On our return in 1820, 
really in 1819 the house


was found too small
for the falmily and they 
removed first to stocks
Hartfordshire and ultimate
ly to a family seat in
Somersetshire. I saw them
through all this and
after many trials and
conflicts which I need
not detail on the 26th
of October 1821 was received
in the Srs House at Bedford
with true sisterly kind
ness by Sr Brogden
Sr Harke and the 
sisters dwelling in
the house. 


I went a learner and
am a learner still
Many changes have I seen
and passed through among
the Brethren and have
had much to learn and 
an in a way I little an

office in our schools is par
ticularly trying to those
who join the church
in mature years who
have not being brought
up among them
But I bless the Lord for
my call of grace and 


rejoice with humiliation
to be numbered with his
people and among the
flock of his fold As in
dividuals & especially
myself we do I fear come
far short of what we ought
to be. O may He graciously 
pour out His Holy Spirit
upon us so that quickened
to new life we may love
Him more and serve
Him better. Soon I may
through abouding won


drous mercy see His
gracious face -- and
would acknowledge the
tender sympathy and
kindness which during 
this season of weakness
I have received from 
my beloved Brethren
and Sisters in the 
Lord. May He bless
keep and guide them
into eternal life.
