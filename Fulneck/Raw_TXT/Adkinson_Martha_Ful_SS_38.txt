& Class Sisters, She was born Scols? in the
Parish of Birstol June 18 1743, & has been in
connection with the Brns Church from her child-
hood as Her parents belong'd threto, & it was
perceptible that she had drawing of Grace
in Her Heart when she belong'd the Gr Girls
choir Therefore had the previledges of
all the opportunities belonging to that choir
yet she drew no particular connection nor
discovered any real concern for the prosperity
of Her Heart till about the year 60, having
been at Her Class in which the spoke of some
particular Happiness she injoy & Her Course
was very ???? & ???? thro' her ??
at that time thro' Her years was very ??? &
of Life & also situation of abode made it that old
on Certain?
had not the approbation she Expected, therefore
she was greatly afronted, & made a resolution never
to come more amongest the Brns people, but
turn into the world & make the best she could to
her advantage, but this lasted not long for such
Strong conviction seized her that utter ruin would infect?
& mislead of puting her worldly resolution into practice
she was oblig'd thro' the Necessity of her own Heart
to declare into her parent, that she must go to his


in the Choirhouse or she cou'd have no rest, they was
surpris'd to hear such a declaration & told her prehaps
the Choirhouse Sisters wou'd not have her, but she took
the resolution to speak with for Aunt Rose Mortimer about it

& was received into the Congregation the following spring
1762 she did not seam to give any real Testimonie of
a Chereful course amongst us till the beginning of
the reading of the 12 word of our dr Savr relative to
the general Synod, these brought her to a strict
Examination of herself seeing many of for
choir companions go to the Hly Commuion from time to time
& she still left behind, it was a real Tryal to her
& when the accounts belonging the general Synod
was Communicated our deceased Sister came under
& strcit Examination in her own Heart & by the
occasion of the feeling which then persisted in the Cong
she thought she also stood in need of our dr Savrs Gracious
Absolution, this conviction seized Her more & more & obliged
her to retire into the wood, by a real drawing in Her
heart that our Savr would absolve Her there for she
had never fell before such need of Grace & pardon
what she injoy'd here with Her Souls Lover was a
comfortable & unabiding blessing to Her Heart,

directions to serve as Cook in the Oeconomie at little ??
& Her leaving the Choirhouse became a great
Tryal to Her not understandinly House business  Till within some month before
Her depature, haveing thro Grace got to see that
the whole perplexity was Her own Makeing


& cane more chearfull, Clear and conforted
and Like a child sung verseseaken

the Srs, was Extraordinary chearfull
and happy for Her Election of Grace
Exprest Herself very Sinnerlike and
thankfull, Senceible of Her great unworthiness
and that she had the favour to Cleave

felt Herself with Soul & body devoted
to Him who hath so much forgiven Her
on the 30th she the Breckfasted with
Her Srs was quite well & Extraordinary
chearfull with them, After which she
went about Her usual Buissness
