Br. James Cromark born at
??? in Jany 1767 & baptised in the
Ch of Engld, but his father joining
the Brn soon afterwards he brot his chil
dren regularly with him to our chapel
?? also that ??? (he knew the truth) from
our souls childhood, & was made ac
quainted with the people among whom
he subsequently cast in his lot. When
12 or 13 yrs. of age he was put appren
tice to clothier of the name of Mir
field of Green?? Pudsey whose wife
was also a member of our choir
so that he had still attended the
means of Grace here. Some yrs
after his apprenticeship termina
ted he marrd his present widow & in
1798 they were both added to our
Society & afterwards recd into the
Congn & admitted to the H. Comn
together, & have ever since remain
ed attached & faithful members.
The good deed of the word was early
sown in our late Brs heart so that his
understanding was enlightened, his
conscience made tender & his heart in
clined to fear Gods, & hence his con
duct was never, even in his youth
loose or immoral; on the other hand
he always shunned evil company
& maintained a good character. It was
however under the ministry of the late


Br John Hartley that both he & his ???
ner were incited to devote themselves
unreservedly to their Savr & to seek
fellowship with a Xtian Church &
they joined our the Congn because they
felt themselves divinely called to
it. During the 46 yrs. that our
late Br has gone in & out among
us, we saw in him the testimony
that he walked humbly with his God
that his faith was simple & childlike
& no doubt his heart was purified
by means of that faith for it wrought
by love - the love of God shed abroad in
his heart by the H. Ghost,  for & he evi
dently loved both the Lord, & his people.
He made no ostentatious display of
his piety, was a quiet, retiring
unobtrusive character & a man of
few words; but that he had experien
ced grace & lived in communion with
the Friend of his soul was manifest
from his whole conduct & spirit;
when he did speak on spiritual
matters, his words tho' few, were to the
point & particularly during his
last illness, when the love of Christ a crucified Savr
displayed to & in him, a poor sinner
was the subject. his eyes might be
seen suffused with tears. His charac


ter was such, that he was beloved by
his family (& especially his children,
whom he & his partner strove to bring
up in the nurture & admonition of
the Lord, & that Lord blessed their exen-??
tions & heard their prayers) & respec
ted by all that knew him.
4 or 5 months ago he fell ill of the
jaundice, & tho' he seemed to get over
that disease, dropsical symptoms
appeared in his legs, which after re
maining stationary for some time,
began to spread rapidly about a fort
night ago, & compelled him to take
almost entirely to his bed. He seems
to have apprehended his approaching
dissolution from the first, but was
perfectly resigned to his divine Master's
will. he was always found cheerful
when visited, humbly yet confident
ly trusting in our Savr & only desi
rous to be made ready for his
coming. Last week he felt some
what gloomy & doubts & fears some rather
what harassed him, probably no doubt in con
sequence of bodily pain & increasing
debility; yet in the under of all he
told his wife he knew it was but a
transient season of distress & for that
his Redeemer would comfort & assure
him again. Last Friday I called


upon him & administered to him the
consolations, which are calculated so abundantly to
cheer & strengthen a child of God, when
walking thro' the valley of the shadow of
 death, reminding him of the many sweet
& precious promises given to the afflicted
believer & above all, of the all suffering
of Him, in whom he had believed the all
ataining virtue of His blood the perfectness
of his righteousness, of his being so ten
derly compassionate a high-priest, 
of His being Jesus Christ same yesterday 
to-day & for ever. These precious truths
& promises served to revive his spirit
& I then commended him in fervant
prayer to the mercies of his God & Savr.
He assured me, before I left him, that he
felt much comforted, the tears meantime
trickling down his cheeks. Indeed, he re
mained cheerful to the end, & told his
partners, not long before he died, that he
was perfectly tranquil & happy in his
mind, full of confidence in the Savr.
& longing to depart & to be with Xt!
He fell asleep in Jesus without a
struggle or a groan, on Tuesday morn 
last abt. 5 a.m., aged 77 years.
He had 10 childr, 5 of whom have pre
ceded him into eternity, & 25 grand
children, most of whom are still living
& many of them scholars in our Sun
day School. May the Lord give them all
grace to follow in their father's or grandfa
ther, as far as he followed Xt. & visbly
comfort & graciously guide & sustain our
dr. Sister, his aged & afflicted widow!
