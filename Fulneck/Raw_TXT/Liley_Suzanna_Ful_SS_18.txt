Apri 25 1745
in ye year 44 there was the first Regulation, of Class's made,
This proved to her a gret blessing; and She went on very happly some time
but She being of a curious turn of mind, and Loveing to prey into
matters, at one time She got in to Some Conversation with a
Sertain person, which proved some what hurtful to her
But however; She soon got helped; for her Natural Disposs

as it was to those who had ye Care of her,
in the same year She was Reced in to the Congregation, She now
thought She was out of all danger and that nothing more
Could happen to her, wereby She came into acertain dryness
for some time, which proved very heavey to her; as She was very
upright an Conscientious; wch was thought that her being mad[e]
a pertaker of the holy Sacrament, might prove the mens of
bringing her in that right Course of Grace, which She her
self as well as her Labours, percived was yet a wanting

Sufferings, which He soon granted, a great Charge
was then Wrought in hers which was very descernable
to all who Coversd with her, & When She was spoke
with her the following Lord supper it was to the Mutual
Satisfaction of her self and her Labourer, it was then
Alowed her to go again to the holy Sacrament; to which
She had not been Admitted for some time, but on Accont
of some Smal Circumstance. She Chose rather to desir
all of time following; what our Saviour tho granted
her to enjoy proved such a blessing to her heart which she 
Cou'd never forget; and which She related with many tears
of joy about a fort Night before her happy dissolution
