died May / 45
Our late Sr Elizth Procter was born
just outside the settlement Septr 10th / 19
& baptized on the 19th by Br Ramftler
In Augt / 26 her mother departed this life
happily. On her deathbed she was much
distressed at the thot of leaving her hus
band with 6 little children, but she fer
vently commended him & them to the Lord
& we have every reason to believe, that
He graciously heard & answered all her
prayers for them; four of her children
have now joined her happy spirit, we
may confidently say, in the realms of
bliss; & the other 2 are, we trust, & be
lieve, earnestly desirous to follow them. 
In her childhood our late Sr attended
the Day School for Girls held in our
Sisters House & was early. The
H. Spirit early commenced a work of 
grace in her soul, impressing her with
a sense of her Savrs love, & a desire to
live to him; this manifested itself
in a hatred of all evil, & those that good
fruits of the spirit which are produ
ced even in childhood. She was always
of a very amiable disposition, & beloved
by her superiours & equals, by old & young. 
She has for several years kept her fa
thers house in which that capacity shewn
great prudence & management, & in
deed in all respects been a most af
fectionate, dutiful & valuable daugh
ter. She was confirmed & admitted
to the holy Comn in Decr. 1837, being
desirous to enjoy all the means of
grace which ?? has esteblisted in his


church, & to make a public profession
of her faith & her love to the our Savr.; & we
rejoice to hear her be able to magnify the grace of
God that was given in her by saying that
she walked worthy of her high calling &
??? by her meek & quiet spirit,
her spiritual frame, & her blameless 
conduct, that she walked humbly with
her God & clave to Jesus with purpose
of heart. In May / 41 her elder
Sr. Agnes departed this life of con
sumption at the age of abt 24; in April
/ 43 her brother Joseph, aged 19, followed
her into eternity, & in May last year
George, and 22 1/2, all dying of the same
disease, & all falling asleep in Jesus;
the latter indeed was a brand snatched
from the burning, yet he was we believe,
a true penitent & died a pardoned &
regenerate believer: his late sisters
conversation & evangelical counsel especially during his last illness was
probably none of the least officious
means employed by our Savr. for bring
ing abt this blessed change in him. 
Elizabeth nursed all these patients
throughout their lingering & at
last painful illness complaint with exemplary
tenderness & patience; to make them
as comfortable as possible, & to direct
their thoughts to spiritual things seem
to be her study & delight; nor did she 
ever appear to think highly of herself for
her exemplary conduct in this respect;
far less was she ever heard to murmur
& complain. When her brother George


died last May, she was already very
unwell consumptions of the same com
plaint that her brot had; & brt to an
early grave developed themselves in her
more & more; she was well aware of
this herself & said more than once that
she believed she should follow them at
no great distance of time. In the
course of the late severe winter she
grew rapidly worse, & it was soon evi
dent that her days were numbered, &
that the spring of the present year would
probably put an end to her sufferings & her
earthly existence. She continued how
ever to come downstairs as long as she
possibly could, & was not many weeks
confined to her sick chamber. Until 
the disease had nearly consumed her
lungs & her strength was well nigh
spent, she did not suffer much pain,
her principal ailment being increasing
weakness; but when the pulmonary or
gans were nearly destroyed, & her
bodily powers all but exhausted, she
suffered greatly, chiefly from diffi
culty of breathing & a sense of suffe
cations; this increased most distressingly
on Monday last abt 2 o'clock p.m. & continued 
for 7 or 8 hours; at length, however, the
disease seemed to have exhausted its
power virulance, & she lay quiet & apparently
easy till 1/2 past 12 o'clock on Monday 
morning when the happy moment came 
that delivered her from all pain from
sin & sorrow, her spirit ascending to
Him who needs & redeemed her.


The writer of this brief memoir
can truly say that he never witnessed a
more satisfactory, peaceful & happy
sick & deathbed than that of our late Sr
She manifested that truly meek & quiet spirit
which is in the sight of God of great price;
a deep humility, arising from a sense of
her own sinfulness, yet at the same time
an habitually peaceful & even cheerful
frame, so that even when her sufferings 
bef above described were at the highest, the
smile that constantly lit up her counte
nance was still beaming there; not a 
word of murmuring ever escaped her
lips; on the other hand, she spoke conti
ually with deep gratitude of the
many & various mercies she enjoyed, & 
of her being spared acute pain, saying:
"O how graciously I am carried and
what cause have I for thankfulness!
She was most grateful to all who shewed
her any attention, & especially for spiri
tual conversation which for spiritual 
& heavenly things being now her element
& her chief joy; she was delighted when thanks
giving & prayer were offered up by her
bedside. Twice, during her illness, the
holy Comn was administered to her in
the presence of a few friends; & both times
she was quite overcome with feelings of
peace, love & joy in the sense of her Savr's
dying love & of His pardon & nearness.
Indeed, it may truly be said say & the
circumstances the more remarkable,
as it is somewhat uncommon even in
the case of the most established & experi-
enced - that he never once, or any


occasion, even when her sufferings were
most severe, heard a word of complaint
from her lips saw even a transient
cloud obscure darken her mind, which was con
stantly serene & cheered by the light
of her Redeemer's countenance. X She
was most affectionate to all around
her & spoke in a very instructive &
encouraging strain to her young friends
& relatives of the things that make
for peace, begging them to continue ear
nestly to seek that one thing ??? soul
everlasting portion which now made
her so blessed, tho' hastening to the
grave in the bloom of youth. And
whence all these striking & lovely fruits
of righteousness, so richly nurtured in
her? Whence but from her such simple child
like, unwavering faith in Jesus, her
placing all her trust in him, looking 
to him & him alone, & keeping good
hold of him as her all; in a word, "holding
the beginning of her confidence fast unto
the end." Often did she declare, that
she had no hope but in her Savr, but
that she knew that he was her's & she
His; & that she had now no other desire but
to go to him, knowing assuradly, that
he would receive her. On Sunday abt
between 1 & 2 o'clock she recd the blessing 
for her departure during a sweet sense
of our Savrs presence & peace. On
Monday evening as our Sunday scholars
were perambulating the place with mu
sic & singing, it was suggested that a verse 
or two should be sung under her window. 


Accordingly the 1st & 6th Verses of No
were sung & played there, viz. The Savr's
blood &c. & And when my Sav I shall see &c.
She afterwards said to a friend who called
to her say that she had heard & understood
the verses, & enjoyed it greatly. She
lived about 5 hours after this, was sensible
to the last, & expired wihtout a sigh or a
groan age 25 1/2 years, receiving the end 
of her faith, even the salvation of her
soul.
X When she first saw that her recovery
was impossible, she felt much, indeed,
at the thot of leaving her father, as 
she knew what a severe trial her loss
would be to him; but it is doubt
& fears of a spiritual nature that
are here alluded to, & praise which
she was most mercifully preserved.
