The S. Sr Rachel Roebuck was born
in Huddersfield Feb. 14th 1735.
She came to live in Fulneck Oct: 14
1760, the following year she was
recd into the Congn and Jan. 11. 1767
she partook for the first time
of the H. Comn. The most of
her time amongs us, she spent in
serving families on the place, in
which situations she showed great
faithfulness; and injoyed the love
of those whom she served. 
a few years ago she removed into
the Srs House here, being far advanced
in years and not able to do much.
She spent her time happily amongst
us and her chief concern was to live
in fellowship and communion
with our Saviour Abl About a
fourthnight before her departure
she was seized with an inward
pain, from which she never recovered 


tho' she was able to go about; nearly
in her usual way, but it seemed
clear to her that she never should
be better, she often prayed earnestly 
to our Saviour to prepare her for
himself, and she loked forward with
joy to that happy moment when
pain and sorrow would seize cease and she
should be with him for evermore.
Dec 28th after having spent a trouble
some night, & suffered much with
shortness of bl breath, she said
in the morning, that she should
never go to to bed again, our Saviour
would fetch her before another
night, and so it proved according
to her faith, about 1 a Clock at
noon, the wished for hour came
when she in a peaseful and happy
manner went over into the arms of
her beloved Saviour. Aged in her 80 year
She departed Dec. 31 1812.
