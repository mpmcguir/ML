The course of Life of Sister Mary Mortimer
1765 I was born June ye 29 1709, in the Parish
of Leeds of Relious Parents, who attend the Church
of England in the stricktest manner, was also carefull
to have me Educated in the principals and practice
of the same, which I did not like, believing it time
enough to become good and Religious, when one grew
old and not deprive ones selfe of taking pleasure in 
ones younger years, but it was not long after those
reflections but I got frequaint conviction about my
future State, that continued till Mr Ingham began
the Preaching in those parts, by means of which my
convictions came more upon me, and I frequantly spoke
to my dearest Savr, who let me see my lost state and
corrupted Nature in such a manner that I was frite
frightend into deep dispair for upwards of five weeks
together in this great distress being one day quite
alone, I coud say nothing, tho' my heart was fitt to break
but dearest Savr make me willing to believe on Thee and
immediatly a powerfull voice made answere ask for his
Bloods sake, and this was repeated to me twice so loud
that I was almost dumb with fear and amazement,
but I spoke with a trembling voice, dear Savr for thy
Blood sake help me, which he did that very moment
and let me feel his rich forgiveness and total
absolution of all my Sins, & I felt his Blood so powerfully
in my Heart as by words I cannot express the feeling, and
those precious words was so imprinted upon my mind as if
never to be forgoten by me hence forth. Ill bear this on
my heart my all is purchas'd by thy smart, Thy Blood
Signs my release. So far her own words


from this time our dear Sister became more chearfull
and conversant with Mr Ingham Br Telche and
others who at that time visited at her Br House
Of which she had the management and direction of
the same and there by had many agreable oppertunity
of refreshing the Brn & Srs on the heartys manner
when they calld upon them, and when the Sisters
began the Oeconomy at Holm she made freequant
little visits with her work, but did not venture
with her thoughts so far, as to think that our Savr
cou'd make her to such a Sisr as those must be who
coud in fellowship unite to live together for the 
Savrs sake, the feeling of her unworthyness made
her often doubtfull & disponding about our Savrs love
towards her, & in the year 1750 June ye 19th when her
reception in the Congren was mad known to her, she
was astonishingly surprisd and timerous to believe
it, on this ocassion and thro' her Br Richds Marrage
the Sisrs House became more dear and acceptable
to her and in August following the same year 
she removed for good live amongst them, but her
shiness towards our Savr made her course anxious
& disponcng, till August 13th 1750 at which 
time our Savr permitted her to become a participant
of His holy Corps & Blood, which she believ'd
some good Sister had interceeded to our Savr in her
behalf, this grace brought her more to a Sinnerlike
reliance upon her wounded Friend, and from this
time she became more familier & conversant with
him and injoyd right happy Hours and days wth
the Congn and he Choir, being fundamental


attachd to the Same in Principals and Practice
of the same in which she had a real joy who ought
was done to our Savrs Honour and when otherwise
she was also pain'd, she was one of those Sisrs
who moved first into the Choir house, which
happy lot of Grace was much esteemd and highly
valu'd by her and the fear of becoming Expencive
to her Choir has made her live an Abstenious
and very Industreous Course of life more so than has suted
with her Constitution, or the desire of her Choir
Sister who often otherwise advised her, but the
woud say I am much ashamed to think how my dear
est Savr causes both young and old in this House
to love me and show such tender treatment as they do
therefore I ought to do my best rather then be burd
endsome in return, I know often pain my Savr
Heart by my anxious way of thinking, but hes so gracious
he forgives me all and I hope you think on me before him
which was a request she frequantly made use of in her
conversation bands and Clases when she was with Sisrs
that she thought had a close connection with our Savr
having always a poor opinion of her self, the results of
the late general Synod had a moving effect upon her
our Savrs 12 words came so closly on her faults of deviation
that her very Marrow and Bone was sized with holy awe
trembling, but the obsolving Grace of her Hearts best
Friend comforted and heald all her back Slidings, and
she was truly thankfull that sheaken those days and
the dear Congn, and when spoke with by her Labrouse
to the Holy Sacrament, she was Childlike senceable
of her great unworthyness to such grace and her great
Humility gave one a real attachment to her


Person. about a 12 Month since her bodily weakness
has increasd much, and with great diffucalty she
has done a little Work for her diligence incited her
much begand her Strength, and about a Month before
her disolution she retired into the sickk room, with 
a real believe that no Medicen coud be any healing
Blamsan to her but the last kiss from his pael Lips
which she childlike waited for with retired resignation
having few words and as little complaint of her
disserder as was possable for any one to speak of who
Labour'd under such a bodily weakness & as proved her
disolution in so short a time; her many thanks
and Sinner Tears Lay'd at her Bridegrooms feet
for his Electing Grace and blessed Leading her thro'
this time meet with a kind acceptance from her
gracious Lord, who according to her great desire
during a sweeet Litturgy was fetch'd home into
the Arms of her beloved with the blessing of her
Choir, in the 56 year of her Age
departed the 27th of decbr 1765
