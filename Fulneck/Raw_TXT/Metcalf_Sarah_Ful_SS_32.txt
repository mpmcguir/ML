The Course of life of the Single Sister Sarah Metcalf
I was born at Southowram febr. 16 1708 & Baptzd in 
the Church of England, & many drawings of Grace 
was perceptable to me in my Childrens years which
I made use of by in the dutys of the Church in hopes
of pleasing God, to the Saving of my Soul from
Eternal Distruction, & as I grew in years I beleived
myself in such a State of happiness prefable to my
dear mother that I became so concerned about her Salv.
that I cou'd have no heaven in Eternity without Her
tho' I had no knowledge of our Savr or that there was
any other Salvation then what was founded on a
religious Life & conversation - & perceived a real
Enmitie in my heart to any one that thought themselves
better then myself, yet at the same time felt many
Emotions in me after the evil & vanities of the world
& plainly perceived that my pious course of Life was
& continual dissappointment to me to the working
up wrath & disscontentment, & when my Br told me that
my Sister had experience the forgiveness of Her Sins
in the bitterness of my Soul said it was all falseness &
delution for there was no such thing to be attaind, my
necessities of heart brought me to frequent the Meetings
kept by the Brns at Smithhouse & also at my fathers
yet a midst all this I lik'd not to venture upon any


foundation
then my own works & selfrighteous & quotation from
the Scripture for my walk & conversation yet my heart remaind as hard as Stone
& I found it a perplexing Circumstance to my Mind
when ever I thought of being separated from my mother
Either in Time or in Etermity & continued to live with my parents
till they both departed out of time which to the best
of my remembrance was about my 35 years.
I apply myself closely to the preachings Especially those
kept by Br Spaningburg which prov'd a great
blessing to me I was also look into bands & Class as
amongest the Single Sisters, & a midst all carry'd Many
disstressing Conviction of my lost condition particularly
at my Spinning one day I was Sized with such Terrors
of Hell & damnation that I saw myself in a Much
worst situation Then Judas, who betray'd the Lord
of Life & Glory, those terrors was succeedd by a
comfortable asshurence that my Crucified Savr had
died for all my Sins, the cherefulness of heart
which I now enjoyed sweetend all the Labour of my
attendance of my sick Brother who thro Lameness had been some
years confined unto his bed, & as I was one day going
to fulneck to the Meeting, I open meself a verse as following
oh Church of God redeemd Bride, believe it & thereby abide
this strength & refresh my heart so as If a Savr Covenantd
with me to remain His & His people forever mine
July 24 1748 I was received into the congregation which


which was a great Grace to me, my Br from this
Time Sicken very perceptably & thro' the repeated
visits of the Brns got a Clear Manifestation of
our Savr redeeming Love & departed happyly in a
comfortable relyance of His blood & merits, & in 2 months
Time I had the Oppertuinity given to remove into the
Oconomie at Cleckheaton in which place I injoy'd many
happy hours & days & from thence a move to the occonomie
at low house & also after that upon the Hill as I become
incurable in my health it gave me a better Oppertunity to
injoy the meeting of my Choir & congregation & on aug 4
1749 I had the inexepressable Grace to become a participant
of the body & blood of Jesus Sacrementily, which was
a matter of great abasement for me poor unworthy worm
at the removal of the Choir into the Choir house
I was one of that number, that had the Grace to be one
of the first inhabitants, & injoyd that perticular
previlidge of being at the Choir Communion kept
by the dear Deciples & have enjoyed all the blessd
previlidgs of the Choirhouse to the Mutual Satisfaction
& blessng of My heart which thro' the various schooling
of the dear Holy Ghost have got to see what a poor wretchd
& spoilt Creature I have been & am by nature, but thro'
his bloody merits I have been inabled to walk my Course
with Joy & comfort as a poor Sinner, & wish from the
bottom of my heart to have been & seen more & more


more & more of that great Happyness that is injoyable
in a Humble & Sinnerlike walk & conversation yet
a midst all my Great poverty & innabilitie of Heart
I wish'd to be in any wise a Joy & Satisfaction to my dear Savr
yet in his aboundant Love & mercy he coud like
to prove it to the Grace of being Choir Diciples
in which period I felt my choir near & dear to me
Even to have cost me tears to feel which an inabilities
& unworthyness to such a Grace & the dear H Ghost
often Testified to my heart that a Savr & His rich
merits was a sufficent for me & my choir & I was
Glad & thankful to let go all self righteousness &
feel my self a needy Sinner before my Lord & Saviour
thro percied Feet.
