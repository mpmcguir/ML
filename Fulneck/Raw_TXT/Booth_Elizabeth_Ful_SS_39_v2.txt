Elizh Booth
I was born Sept 22 1735 at Mirfeild My parents
belonged The Church of Engl, in My younger yrs
I came into a Concern about My Salvation & according
to my way of Thinking had it very much at heart
to please the Lord in hopes that he wou'd save
me, in My 6 year I had a particular Impression
from a dream were I saw our Savr in My room I
went to him & askd him to bless me me, he told me
 I must be dipt in a fountain & then I shoud be his
which promise I never forgot
when The Brn came to preach at Fox rojd I went
thither with my Mother & got a Love for them
when Br Helt came to have the care of the
Children His Meeting was a great peculiarly blessed to
my heart & in particular when he Spoak of our
Savrs death & Suffering to purchas our Salvation
I was very much affected thereby & M & my heart
Melted into Tears, as I grew older I felt my corruption
& the great propensity I had to Sin Made me very
dark & Miserable as I thought no one was so Spoilt
& full of Evil as I felt My Self altho I had a Love
for Sin yet through disstress of mind I was fridened
from commiting of gross Sins & instead of going to our Savr as a 
Sinner I fell to Self working & striving to belief
but coud attain no consolation for my Soul by it.
I often used to walk alone & pour out my concerns before
the Lord but Still preceived that my Missery increased
& felt as If I shoud be condemd & lost forever beleiving
it Impossable for our Savr to have Mercy upon such
a wretch as Me in this My Disstressd Condition


I was visited by the Sisters to them I Spoke My whole
heart as well as I cou'd & beg'd them to tell me If there
was Grace & Mercy for me they comforted & incouraged
me Much & told me that it was our Savrs Grace that 
made such deep disscoveries of my Sinfulness that
he Might Heal & Save Me, but I being of a reasoning 
turn of Mind Soon doubted of the realitie of this & woud
not be comforted any other way then by our Savr
Manifesting himself personably to My heart as
Clearly as If I saw him with My bodily Eyes
I wou'd believe my Sins forgiven.
I continued in a heavy Course for a Considerable
Time through My unbeleive of Heart not withstanding
my dearest Savr never Left me his poor Child but
followed me with unwearied patience but in 
My 17 year I began to grow tired of my own attempts
to help my Self & thought If perish I will now perish
at My Savrs feet
one day when I was praying our
Savr to take me as I am I had no sooner given my
Self into the hands of my redeemer, but he was pleased to mani
fest himself to me, & Stood So Clearly before My heart
& Eyes in His wound figure so that I was quite Struck
& overcome with his Beauty. here I felt the assurance
of the forgiveness of all My Sins by which My great distress
of heart & mind was quite removed Oh how I felt I shall
never forget my heart was quite captivated by my bloody
freind who was now becomed my Only Object I can
never Express in words what peace & Life My poor
heart injoyd for I Say of a truth when in his
blood I saw him Swim a Small drop I did get, which freed
him to me me to him the first time that we meet,


After This a desire arose in My heart to be receivd
into The congregation tho' I felt My Self very unworthy
of that Grace Therefore I said nothing of it to my Labourer I Spoke Childlikely to our Savr
about it leaving it at the Same Time to his decision
being very Timerous of myself Least Least I 
Shoud not prove unseen & faithfull to that happy lot of Grace to our Savr, & his people
however not withstanding all my unstillness our Savr Grantd
Me that favour on nov. 13th 1752 here I gave My Self anew
to become a joy unto our Savr & his congregation in the
beginning of the year 53 I had recieved the ????? news brought
Me, that I had leave to come into The Choirhouse & My long
wishd for desire was attaind on feb 3. And on the 13of augt
I was receved into The Single Srs Choir on this day on this to me
Ever Memorable day I devoted myself anew in
with Soul & body to My Manhood only Spouse to
become a true virgin to him
in the year 53 Sept 9 I had the unspeakable Grace
to become a participant of our Savrs body & blood in
the holy Communon, This melted me like wax in
the dust befe at My Bridegooms feet Thus I went
on in a Cherefull happy Manner & in 1754
when Our dr papa & Mamagen was hear I had
the favour to be present at that so remarkable
Choir Communion what that proved to My heart
Im not able to disscribe in words, from that time on
the dr Holy Ghost begun a new school with me
wherein I became truely more &none Senciable of my
Great difference in the Choir point & that there
was Many things in Me which wanted be be deadend
& Sanctified thro The power of his Corpses & blood
my proud & hasty dissposition of mind Cause Often
caused me also great UnEaseyness of mind & deprived me
often of that Sinnerlike Connection wth My Sister but my


faithfull Friend did never let me rest till he
had brought me again unto the Sinners point
& convinced me what for a poor creature I was
in 1761 I was Made use of aMongest the great Girls
in which I felt My Self very unfitt however not
withstanding the Many Tryals which I meet it
proved a blessed School in which our Savr shewd the
many things which in regard to my Self I had Still
been Ignorant oft this Made me often weep before
my Only Matchless heart on account of My great
poverty, but his precious nearness comfortd & helpd
me thro' from Time to time
& I can never be thankfull Enough to My dearest Savr
for the Manifold Grace & blessing that I have
injoy in My Choir dureing My Last 10 years for
of my Aboading  with the Sisters for which I will
Kiss his Thro' bored feet Millions of roses when I come to when I 
come to him, Im at present in the Sickroom
where I Spend my time in a tender Longing after
My dearest Bridegrooom, & can assure My Srs that
there is Nothing between Me & My beloved I am
quite Cherefull & Satisfied in heart & mind & longd to
go to our Savr as a poor pardond Sinner who has
nothing to bring before him but his bloody right
ousness so faire her own words
This Our Sistr haveing been Subject to a affecktic dissorder
for Several years past She in 63 Spring got a pain in her
side attended wth a Sore Cough wch occassiond her
to Think she shoud not be long that she woud not
have Many years to Spend hear but did not Seam
to be so quite Clear about her going home at this
Time & accordingly Grew bettr again but Still
retaind a deep impression in her Mind that


She Shoud go the following year about the
Same Time & thought of it wth a great deal
of pleasure & often Spoak in a feeling & tender
manner of the blessd work of the dr Holy Ghost
in her Heart, According to the Grace which
our Savr had imparted to her she was intrusted
She was Made Use of aMonge the grt Girls as
there band keeper & helper in their room, in
which She Acted with a willen & faithfull
heart, as to her natural disspostion it
often Caused her much pain & unEasyness
not withstand all this her Connection with
our Savr was Evident to all about her,
in Jan Last she got a relaps of her former
dissorder & when Adviced to use some Means
from the doctr She Complyd out of Obedience
but fully believed she shou'd go home this
time, in febr she who added to the Company of
preists, & being Spoak wth to that purpose
She Answerd in a Sinnerlike manner
I feel very Much ashamed of this favour
but I am Glad & thankfull to My dr Savr &
likewise to my Brn & Srs for it's tho' I am Sure
I Shall not be Able to injoy the Meetings attend any
of those meeting with them yet
I will Speak with My hearts best freind at
those times as well as I can, The 17 of Mar.
She betook herself to the Sickroom, when
She cou'd not Enough Express her ardent


desire of being soon with our dr Savr
in Ap she had a Cherefull Lovefeast wth
her Class Sistrs whereby She Express how
happy & Satisfied she fell at this time to
what She had been a year ago, as now Our
Savr was become her darling Object her days
& hours & Moments was become a perpetual
Sabath to her so that If her time had become
Longer then On the 20 ??? She partook once more of her
Lords Corpses & blood as a balsom to her Love
Sick Soul which took it flight the
following day into its & Thus she spent 
her Moments in tender wanting for the
Last kiss from her bridegroom Lips
