I was Born in the town of Mirfield in Yorkshir in the year 1735
on the 29 of Sept, my parents belonging the Church of Ingland In my
young years, begun to be Consarned about My Salvation & was affraid
of doing of saying any thing which would Displeas God for fear I Might
not be saved one Night when I was about 6 years old I dreamt our
Sav came into the Room were I was, as soon at I saw him got up & ran
to him & pray'd him to Bless me which he did & I thought he Showd
me a well in the side of the room In the which he said I Should be
dipped of then I should be his it had such an Imprection on me
that I never forgot it when the Brethen came to preach at foxwood
I went with my Mother & got a Love for them In some time after
Bro Helt came to have the Care of the Children so he told us as Many
us had a mind to be our Saviours Should wright a few lines to him
which I did also his Meetings was peculery Blest to my heart &
When he told us of our Savs becoming Man and that he he was
crusyfyed of had Recved So many wounds for as to perchase our Salvation
I was very much lade hold on & I wept Many times, as I grew older I
??? to to be put in here
felt my Corruption more & more which made me very heavy and
glomy I thought Shurly there is not one that is So Spoiled & So
full of evel as I am, but the Convictions which felt I never went
In no Gross sins yet I felt a love for Sin & begun a self working
a striving to become better, the More I Strove against it the
worse I grew I often took Lonely walks were I might have my thoughts
to myself & allso pour out my Sighs to the Lord, evry thing I saw
Increased my sorow they looked So happy & evry thing answered
the end for what they was formed for but as for me I lothed
myself feeling Nought but Sin, I frequeuted the Meetings
very Constant, I felt as if I was going to be juged for evry Word
As the Bro spoke I tried my own Heart by it to feell if I
Could get any hopes that our Sav would have Mercy on such a
Rech as I am, when the Sisters came to Visit me Sis Lesel and
Eunes Brook being Sisters that had a pecular Confidence to I
felt a grate freedom to tell them my whole Heart as well as ever
I Could in hopes that they Could Gess weather I should come thro or no
they allways Comforted me & told me it was a Grace that our Sav
Let me feell what I was by nature & allso that it was just such that
our Sav came to save, but I being of a reasoning turn it seemed
to be made to very esey & except I felt our Savs Nearness so clear as
& I allmost saw him I dare not beleve & so Long as I have not this
Grace I will not have no other Comfort that is to be assured of the
forgivness of all my Sins, so I went on fo some time struggling


strugling with my Lods as a silly child for if I had a more Simple Heart
I know I Might have found rest sooner, but my dear Sav whose Care
I have been Shure of from a littell Child did not for all my unbeleve
& hardness of Heart did not leave his poor Child but followed me with
Unweared patience tell he Could his ame fullfill so I went on till
my 17 year when I begun to be tired of all my own attempts & to See
clearly I Could do Nothing of myself, so I thought if I perish it shall
be at My Savs feet, but one day when I was praying by myself I broke
out in these words I am a Sinner this I know all in me deserving wo
but Sence thou has dyed for me my Lamb I pray thee take me as I
am, I had no Sooner giving myself into the Hands of my Sav, to live
but my dearist Bridgroom manifested himself so clear before my
Heart & eys with all his wounds that I was quite overcome with his
Beauty I felt that he had forgave me all my Sins & the Lods I had
Carried was quite gorn O how I felt I shall never forget my Heart
was so Captivated with my Bloody Freind that he was become my
Cheff Object O I cannot express the part what peace & life my poor
heart Injoyed for I can say with truth when in his Blood I saw him
Swim a small drop I did get which glued me to him, him to me the
First time that we meet, I began to think I Could like very Much
to be in the Congregation tho, I felt myself very unworthy of that grace
but I spoke with our Sav about it often, but leaving it at the Same time
to his will for I was affrade of myself not answering the end, I never
told my Cosarn to my Labours for I thought if our Saviour thinks
good I Shall be Reced he will put it into the Bre & Sis, hearts when it
is the wright time, when I came to Fulneck my Labour told me I might
wright to the Congrea, which was very welcome to me so I did & Brought it to
my labour, and in the year 1752 on the 13 of Nov I had the Grace to be
Reced into the dear Cong, of which I felt myself very unworthy of but
I gave myself up to our dear Sav & wished to be a joy to him & to his pepel
soon after I had the unexpected news that I had leave to come in the Choir
House which Suprised me; I allways had a pecular mind to be in the Choir
house or Econemy but I thought it to grate a Grace for poor me, as soon as
my parents Could get my things ready I came which was on the 3 of Feb
1753 when I got my long wished for Desire granted to live in the Choir
House were I lived a grate Girl tell the Mounth of Augt the Singell
Sisters fest being put of tell then on account of our dear Annajonah
& Jonas coming & on the 15 of Augstt I was Reced into the Sisters Choir I felt
a littell pain at parting with my Choir for had injoyed many Blessings


Blessing from our Saviour in it but as it was his will I devoted myself to
by dearist Bridegroom & wished to become a true virgin Both in
Soul & Body to be intirely to his Heart in all things, in the year 1753
on Sep ye 9 I had the Grace to injoy for the First time the holy Screament
for which I was quite bowed down feeling myself so unwothry of such Grace which
I injoyed at that time when I was prevaded with his dear Corps & Blood thro
& thro, in the year 1754 our dear papar & Mammar pade us a Viset and we 
had for the First time here a Choir Scrament & foot washing the impretion of
which I shall never forget it was as if our Sav & me was quite alone for some
time, in a wile after our dear Sav let me see More of myself that I had
a grate deal in me that wanted to be dealing & Sanktifyed thro our Saviours
Grace My Disopition being of such a sort that when I See any thing I thought
not right I was so hasty in speaking which Brought me often into Uneseyness
but our Best Friend allways brought me soon to the Sinner point & let me
feell what a poor Child I was and would not let me be Sattifyed if I had Severd
from him in any thing till I felt his Forgiveness, in May 1761 I  was made
use of Amongst the Girls for which I felt myself very unfetlt but it proved
a Blessed Scoul for my own Heart I got to see many things in myself that
I was Egrant of and made me Cleave Closer to our dearist Sav for his daly
instruction & sweet nearness to bring me thro in all things According to his
Heart, and I Can never be thankfull enofe for all the Grace & Blessing
which I poor Child have injoyed in my Choir the Congreation and 
for which I will kiss his dear feet when I come to him and feell often to ???
in my self of my ?? ?? ???
myself quite Chearfull & Sattifyed there being nothing between my
I am a ??? lot loving nothing?
Dearist Bridegroom and me, I am now in the Sick Room waiting for
the last kiss When he go home I long to see will take me to himself
I have noting to bring
???? my beloved
before him, but his blodig raistifuls I cannot but bless for
Soul.
