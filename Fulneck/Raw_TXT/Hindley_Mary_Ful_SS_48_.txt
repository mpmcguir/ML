Mary Hindly this Born apil 29 1740 at
Warkten Hall in Lancashier, & was Baptisd by a
Disecnting Minister in 1753 She heard ye Metho
dists & so terfied, that she thought, if this be ye right
teaching then I Cannot Possibly be saved, She wou'd
Sometimes get her Sisters & another Girl into ye
chamber & Sing Hymns together but Could ge no
Satisfaction for her Heart, in 1751 She had the Small
Pox, & at that time becose She did not know our Savr;
nor ye for the forgiveness of Sin in his Blood, She
was very much afraid of dying, but these Convictions
seemed to Die again, & her Natural mind was
inclind to go into ye World Which Grived us
Very Much, & made us Concernd & pray to our Saviour to Direct
us how to bring her up for him, But when ye Bn
Came to our house in 1753 our dear Savr began afresh
to Work upon her heart with his sweet grace, &
then She got a desier to be Recived into ye Society,
which after Some time was granted to her & in come
ing to Duckenfield & Seeing ye S Srs & Conversing with
them, She got a desier to go to Live with them, which
was quit to our mind, & helpd her gladly forward
& geting every thing in readiness for her to go which
She also had granted her, to our real joy & her Satisfact
March ye 28th Mary Hindly Came from Shackerly to
to Live with ye S Sisters in Duckenfd according to her desier
& was a pleasuer and Satisfaction to her to Live in their
House & to be amongst them yet they Coud not perceive
that our Savr got much hold in her heart for her Dispsition
was such Such, which Caused bouth her self and others about her
some trouble, which made it Doubious whether She wou'd prosper
among them, nevertheless, they loved her, bore & had patience with
her, & were Perswadedly Sensible that she Loved them also, & when
S Wyrring Spoke to her about any thing, She was directly
resighned & willing to submit, which gave hopes that our Savr


wou'd yet obtain his aim with her, in December Last
she began to be not well of a Swelling in her Leges &
from that time She begun to be more disatisfied with her
Self and became more Concernd about her Salvation, & Said
thatr she was very Sorry that She had spent her time as She
had & made no better use of it, but if our Savr pleas'd, that
she shou'd mend again, She wou'd become wholy his & in a 
Little She grew better, yet one Could not percive much alteration
with regard to her heart, but, our Savr knew ye best, what
to do & her disorder return'd again on her & and ye 28th of Jan
She was Siez's now & then with a sort of Stirick fits & Cortiness??
about a week, then turn'd more inwardly, on Saturday
Night She had a very bad night with regard to body & mind
but She took her Refuge to our Savr, & kept a hearty & Child-
Like band with him about all her Concerns, & he made it Clear
to her that he had forgiven her all her Sins, & notwithstand
ing her many faults and warts, Wou'd Recive her just as she was
& She shoud soon be Call'd home to him, Last Sunday she told
Sr Wyrring what our Saviour had done for her & She belived
He Wou'd soon take her to himself, but she desierd to be
Recived into ye Congregation before She went, no one
Could realy percive there was an alteration Wrought in
her for her Look & Countenance testified of ye same
hitherto when ever She had thought of dying, a Certain fear & dread
always Came on her out now She was glad & willing to go to our
Savr She was now also more pretty & Childlike with the Ss & more
so then ever & was not quite Satisfied but, when they was
about her & According to her desier Br Prosky Came to
See her at Night, She told him how She felt, & what She
Desir'd & as our Savr had granted her all her desirs, She was
now ye most Concernd about being buried in our Burying
ground, the Same Night Betty Brown Wached with
her, She was perticular Chearful & said to her, that She
had felt that Day, that in her heart which She had never felt
before all her life, & and that She shou'd soon go to
our Savr Whom She now Lov'd above all thing, for
he had forgiven her every thing, & Said, he is my Savr
& only Bridegroom & I am his Child & heartly belive
that I am ye Worst & he will take ye worst


the first out of our house, I shall soon be with
him, & then I shall see him as he is. Betty said
to her, when thou Comst there, then kiss our Savrs
feet for me too She readly answer'd I will, & I Shall
thank Him for all He Sufferd on my account & for
Shedding his pricous Blood for me, & for brining
me through. at 2 a Clock she had a fit again, which 
was attended with much pain and so violent that She
did not know how to Contain her self, and Could
Not help Crying out. Betty pray'd her to be as Still
as She cou'd, it would perhaps be soon over again ,
then She answer'd I will, but I am so Ill I do not
know what to do, I wish our Saviour woud soon fetch
me, but I want to be recived into ye Congregation & I
think I must not, & when She was told to pray our
Savr for it, & leave it to him, then She was Satisfied
happy & Chearful again, & desird to have some
Verses sung, then Betty sung her Sev'ral verses
out of ye Hymn O Head so full of bruises & Many
Others beside & were very happy to gether & felt
ye Sweet Nearness of our Savr, about 3 o Clock she
had another fit, when She was a Little better she
said, O I want my father & Mother to Come, for
I shall go soon, & if they do not see me before I go
this will be very much Grived & when She was
told that they wou'd perhaps soon Come, then she Said again,
but doest thou believe I shall be reciv'd before I go,
else I am afraid I must not be laid in ye burying
Ground, next morning she was removed into ye
Parlour at which She was exceeding glad & said,
Now I belive our Savr will fetch me before I go out
of this Room & Spent ye whole day with Sr Wyrring
in a Chearful and happy manner, Br & Sr Prosky
also came to see her, she Could but now and then say to us


think being often interupted by pain, & Signified
her desire to go home to our Savr and about being
Burried, Sally had many Pretty Conversations
about ye Pain which She felt, & ye Pain & Anguish
fore which our Savr felt as ye Lamb of God that
Was Slain indured for her & how one may fetch
Comfort from thence for all our ailments &c. & so She
remaind Chearful & Satified, often Calling out for our 
Savr to come & fetch her, on Tuesday her Father &
Mother came to her, & She was very Glad of their
Company, & orderd with them her Matters.
on wednesday about noon She felt very much Pain
& frequently repeated her desire for our Savr
to come & fetch her, & Ask'd Sally what she must
do on account of ye great pain She felt & when 
She was directed to think on ye Pain our Savr
ye patient Lamb who opend, not his mouth, when
with a human Sencibility felt more pain then
we altogether, when induring the Cross & feeling
ye Scourge & bearing the Doom for our deserts,
to ask and Learn patience of Him, She answer'd
Childlickly I will, & after some more Conversa
tion, the going to our Savr was ye most urged
by her, the afternoon She remaind still & pritty
towards Morning, Mary Sheard Watch'd with
her, there was an Alteration with her, & Ask'd
for Sally & imediatly after, her Soul took
flight to ye Perfected Congrgation above, under
that vers the Soul of Christ the Sanctify
