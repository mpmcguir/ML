I was born at Kerkstill in the parish of Kerkhetten in the Year 1728 My Father was a
Clothmaker In my young Years my parents sent me to School Till I was so
old that I could do some service at home I was of a very brisk & Lively turn of mind
And I perceived often that if God did not preserve me I should run into uter ruing as I felt
My basness & inclination there to stir very much in me my Father & Mother was always
for there Children going to school Church very Constant & I got a great Liking thereto
As I alwas lik'd to here what I could there & when ever I went to Church I uste to pray
the Lord to bless me very earnestly & to bestow great blessing on me I uste to be very
Much Consernd but did not then understand ye meaning thereof One time being in
Very great Distress I went out in the Barn to pray & as I pray'd I wisht to God
that he would answer me my prayer and preserve & keep me to the end of my days
and make me his faithfull Servent but in a perticular Manner I pray'd that he would
Give me his grace at that time, which might endure throought all the Days of
My Life One Night I Drempt that we had Company & I going to attend
on them on a Low flower I ment to men the One was was Drest in dark Collor
and the Other in a Long read Robe he that was in black One ask'd me wether of them I should chose
I was agoing I told him about my busyness he then ask'd me wich of them
too I shoud chose, I then arnesty Looked on them both but did not directly give
it Answer he said wether did I chose Heaven & Hell I said one always chose


Heaven you know he ask'd me again which of us then do you chuse I answerd
him hastily not you, but this and standing nearest him in the Red Robe
I got hold on him he then smiled at me & bowed his Head I also moved to
him and got hold of the robe and wanted to look what was under it he then
smiled again and bow'd his Head & said not yet I then was very much ashamed
that I made so free with him, but he held out his hand & Smiled I then Looking
down to the Ground lost sight of them both and so I awaked with a deep Soncern
On my mind just then about there was a great talk about some prechers
that sung hymns & pray'd & precht in Barns and particularly Misr Ingam who was
just then come out of Jorde they called him a new found pretcher and so my Sisr
And me whent one Night to here him But he mist that Night coming where he
should have precht & so we must here him On my rode I went with some Body
who lent me a little hymn Book I Learnt some verses there by which I uste
frequently to sing soon after this my Mother fell sick & whent in to a Consomtion
And dyd I then thought I had Lost one of my best friends I could have but being
then left with my Father & Grandmother she was very good to me & kept me
very close to my Book especialy asundays so that I might get amoungst
no saught of lose Company, soon after my Mother Departer my Father also
who was really a good & tender father over his Children
Dyd I then whent to service being in my 13th Year I then begun to get more into
things belong to the would which sated my inclination but as I had been brought up in another
way I was not always satisfied there with becaus I did not know there ways rightly My


At one place where I was I fell sick & got the ague where I was obliged to live
My place I had about a duzen or 14 Mile to go back to my native place
And over Larg Commons to some where my master brought me alone back to the
Last Common to so biding Farewell to him I sat me down & began to weep heartily
Being exceeding Burdend with my Cloths & so weak that I scarsely say any means of
getting to my Unkle where I was agowing & have no right home to go to made
it very heard to me But I prayd to God that he would help & direct me how
to go on I wept in a perticular manner thinking that with not praying sickness
had come upon me Now I was not Long destant for ahome as my Ant
in a few Days sent for me & said I should stay as Long as my sickness
Lasted which was a great while but she behaved as a tender mother over me
I then being quit recoverd I went to Harchet to see my Sisr And soon after
then I wen to here Misr Ingam at Fox rode at Mirfeild he preached on 63d Chapr
O Ezah who is this that cometh from edom with dyd Garmants for Bozrah this that
is Glorous in his aperel Traveling in the Greatness of his strength
I was very much tuched at this and though I never heard such preaching in my Life
Soon after I begin to here the Bretheren & I was exceeding miserable thinking that all
Preching & praying prevailed nothing on me but that I should be Lost & mend
forever One Night I was exceedngly overcome with terror & fright thinking
that I should go to hell & so should never be saved But in a little while I begun to grow
eager & so being by my self at my busyness all at once I was exceeding seazed upon for
Our dear Savr at that time manifested him self before my Heart and I say as
Clearly as if I had seen him Crucifyed before my eyes that Left such an imprestion
upon me that I was obliged to set down and I was quiet surprised what was
come to me but and as miserable as I was before so happy was that after for I believed
was, so that they perceived my chearfullness was well so my pease was
I had was often spoken with & told that both going to hear ther prechers I was
growne quite molencolly and again after a little while I begun to grow miserable
again, but I gladly would have overcome it with like mindedness and things belonging
to this world thinking there by to have Satisfaction & strove against it as much
as lade in my power. one Sunday as I whent to Church (and always going to ran ahead)
I though I would miss & so going home I got to my Companons as soon as possible
and while we where to gether the Master of the house cameing & we whent but but he
said as long as we was so altogether (and me amongst them) there would never be no
good done which struck me so when I heard him that I left my Companions
I made a resolution to mis the pritching no more and so but of & when but to rawhead
but the preaching was half over then after a little while I begun to think that I
could like to belong to the society accordingly I whent to Bror & Sisr Ockerhousen
and told them my mind & Intention they askued me if I had quite Lost my
inclination for the things of this world & how a soul should be that was a
County member how was they gave me Leave to go to the ???? she next
time so as soon as my Sisr perceived that I would belong to the Bretheren


She begun to think that I was better then her which caused a great dissagrement
betwen us Brother & Sisr Ockerhousen got ordered me to go to Kane Wartons
where I sayed near too year & from thence I removed to Cleckheaton to Live
with Sarah rite & her Mother being engaged some where else & there I stayed
from thence I removed in the Oeconomy when it begun at Clekheaton
the same year the 22d of May the same Y I was received into the Congregation
soon after I began to think very much about the Lordsupper & the Year
following I became a Candidate in May when Broth Johanas & Benigna
was here & on the 10th of July I had the Grace to be a pertaker for the first time
Which in deed was every particular Grace & Bless for my poor heart & found
it was a real food for my soul here I found my dear Saviour Begun a
new school with me the Next Year after I removed from Cleckheaton
to the home Oeconomy where I stayed about a Year & then I removed
to the Low house to that Oeconomy & from thence to the Toop of the Hill
Hear it was quite a new beganing to me & found it often very
needfull to beg our Savr for Grace to help me thro' with soon after I removed
To the hall to weight on the Bretheren & Sister where I served about 2 Years
??? true I look on this as a great favour I found it was great
Blessing to me to be amongst the Brethren & Sisrs & to serve
them next I removed in to the Choir House but here I found it difficulter
then ever I often pray'd to my Savr to help me thro' with every thing
after awhile I midst the Lords supper on the account of which I did find
it still hard to be a sinner But I pray'd Our Savr that he would for give
Me and take me again as his poor Sinner which he really did in
Our dear Savr gave me Leave to enjoy that highest good the next time
The tim after I mist again but I had leave to go the time following
Now soon after this the a place Congregation was settled which was put very
Close to us and was told us what would be required of every
Broth & Sisr belonging in must do a place Congregation this was a perticular matter to me
and especialy as times was very Critical with me I could not just resolve what
to do firs we had it told by Bror Johanas in the Great Hall when
was realy a Strikeing matter to me after wards in our owne meeting
Hall at firs it put me a little to it but soon I saw there was no way but
to give my self intirely to our Saviour to be his & what he pleas'd to do
with me & that day I never forgot it soon after this I mist the Lordssupper
again then I begun to reason very much & wounderd what was the matter
that things whent so heard I when by myself into the Burying Ground 
and prayd our Saviour that he would make it Clear to me if it was my
right place to be here or no for I realy was quite far & I did not
know what to think & if he had some other view with me he would
make me satisfyd that have ever I might have some Satisfaction. 
my Life some times I prayed our Savr that if he had some other
view with me that he would bless my heart & give me a Grace which
I felt he very often did


Now I begun to think wether I had done right or not with asking our Sav
so far but soon after I became quite Satisfyed & I was clear in my Heart
our Savr was Satisfyed tho' things whent on but poorly soon after it was
told me Conserning going to the Sisrs hous at Beedforde I had not the
Least objections to make on this account but I found it so in my
Heart that if our Savr & his Congn ordered it so with me I was
quite Satisfyd tho' I cant say but it caused me a deal of pain
to leave this dear place Congn where I had so sensible felt my
dear Savrs nearness. We set out on ye 18th of  June in the year 60 with
the Blessing of the Congn & on the 24th we arrived in Bedford in the
Sisrs House here begun quite a new school with our Savr Savr began quite a new school wiht me & I felt 
I stood in need of his nearness in a prticular manner & I often keep band
with my dear Savr to Comfort me for I felt the want of this dear place
Congregation so much that sometimes I could not be satisfy'd but after
awhile I begun to be better Satisfyed for I believed it was the place for me
[Illegible]
[Illegible]
[Illegible]
[Illegible]
[Illegible]
After awhile here [Illegible]
[Illegible]
Then I begun to think that if I could live the Bretheren I should have
nothing against if But as our dear Savr who always steeped before my
Heart Comforted me at that time also not long after it was told me
I should come again to fullneck which I received with a glad heart
and when I got to my dear Choir hous again I beged our Savr to
grant me bouth the Old & new feeling which I can truly say he has now
But I haveing a very sickly Tabernickel since the time of my comeing
it has often caused me perplexity on account of my Comeing thro'
???? at my turn the General Synod being & here what our Savr had to say
to the Congn it affected me very much I thought I must take a great
part there in I often uste to go out & beg our Savr to make a new begin with me
And he did frequently steep before my Heart & Comfort me. In Ocktobr
I feel sick so that I thought that our Savr would take me to himself but how
ever it did not happen at that time Our Savr has had a perticular schooling with
Savr me which in the end has proved perticularly blesst to me this year has been
a very sickly one with me so that I often felt my self very weakly which has
made me think often Our Savr perhaps intended to take me to himself & I do
Injoy his nearness in a perticular manner
