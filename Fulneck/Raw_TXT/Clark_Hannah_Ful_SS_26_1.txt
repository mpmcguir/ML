Hannah Clarl was born in Northowrm near
Hallifax, Decber 1727 and in the year 43 She heard
the Gospel preachd, along with her Sister, after
some time our Saviour Laid hold on her heart
in Such a manner, that She had a great desier
to be long to the Society, but being of a bashfull
deposishon, She Could not say much for her
self, thinking herself not worthy of Such a Saviour
but being in Coragd by her Sr She howeve took
Corage and was soon received into the Socity at
Hallfax by Br Horn; in ye year 48 She came to
Live at Cloketon EOconemy where She Coul was
some time before She cou'd rightly Settle after
ter wards, She growing more acquainted with our Saviour
And grew more Satisfid in the year 50. She remov'd
to with the rest of the Srs to Tyrselhall, were She got
a gret Longing and desier to be recived into the
Congregation, which was granted to her janr ye 12.
1752: the Day after She was Recd, the Sr Askd her
why She was in such a hury to go to grace hall, the day that
She was Recived, She being alway usd to be one of the
Last, O said she I had some thing in my mind, I thought
perhaps I Shall be recievd therefore I did not Like
to be to Late, I had a feeling of it but, I did not Like
to tell any body of it, When the Sisters Enterd the
Choir-hous She with Some others was orderd to Live
in pudsey Town, which grived her very much, and
She said, She Cou'd not reast till She Came to Live
in the Choir-hous, July ye 15 53 She became a
Candidat for the Sacrament ye 4th of Nov. in the same
year She was Confirmd, and Decber ye 6th She pertook of
the holy Sacrament, for the first time; this provd with a
great bless to her, from this time forward she grew
much more Lively and Chearfull then ever, She had
been before, once as She was going to the Meeting She
fell and hurt her knee, her Father being a Dacter She
went to Stay there a while, to see if she Could be Cur'd
but While She was there, She was much dissatisfid
and wanted to be at home again, in the Mean time the
Pudsey EOconemy Came to live in the Choir-hous her Sr
Going to see her, She Askd her if they was moved, She
told her Yes, then said She were is my bed and the rest
of my things, are they in the Choir-hous? She asuerd her


that her bed was in the sleep-hall, this rejoiced her
Very much and She said I am Satisfied if I only
have the faviour to be in the Hous, She Coud not
be Satisfied to stay any Longer with her father
but hastend to come home, and enterd her Choir
house with much pleasuer; ever since She got that
hurt in her knee, She has been Sickley, So that on
could planly see that she was in a declining way
Since that time nothing, during this her Sickness nothing
has hapend to destirb her in her Couers of grace but
She has gone on in a simple, and Child Manner, About
Christmas 55 She got a bad Cough, and it seem'd as if
it wou'd turn to a Cunsumtion, Last janry her Sr went
to visit her father, She Ask her what She Shoud Say to
him about her, She said I have not much for fisik at
present, perhaps byenby I Shall want it more then
now, She was very Still and Complaind but Little
but when She by degrees grew wors, She had a mind
to try if enything Could be of servis to her, She
then Sent to her father but he Said it wou'd be to no
perpos however She took something which gave
her Eas' for a short time, but however it was very deserna-
ble, that her End drew near, this She belived herself
and at first She took it very Near to heart; that
She hat not Spent her time in such a tender, Connecttion
with the man of Sorrows as She Could have wich'd
She spoke of it to her Sister, but however, said She
He: Loves me dearly, and has patiene with me; about
the middle of June, She took to ye Sick-room, when
She was Ask'd if She Shoud not Like to, be well again
She answerd No! I will rather go to our Saviour, wile
She was in the Sick-room, She went once it to the
hall to the holy Sacrament, when She came home
again, She was so ill that we thought She would have gone
directl; but in a little time She recoverd again; when she
Said I am acceding glad that I have enjoy'd it once more
with the Congregation, for it is the Last time, She
was exceeding Light and Chearfull, and said I Can't
Express in words, what I have enjoid by the holy
Sacrament my heart is So refreachd that it has made
me quit Strong, yet my Longing and desier is to go to him
who has done so much for me, O I wish that that happier
time may soon Come, She was thro' her whole sickness


Exceeing patient and when Any one told her that
She Lookd very ill O said she I am to be ill, but it is no
matter; will bear it as well as I Can, it will soon be over
then I shall be quit well,
About a Month ago her Class Sisters gave her a fair-
well Love-feast at which She was very much delighted
this was the Last time of her Comeing out of the Sickroom
When She was spoke to for the Sacrament the Last
time, She Expressd, her Longing desier for it, O Said
She I would gladly have been with our Saviour before;
this time it will however be the Last, I Shall now soon be
with our Saviour; the fourth of this month, She pertook
of the holy Sacrament, with such A longing and
Eager heart, that She Cou'd Scarely wait till the
time Came, when She got the bread into her hands it
Cant be express'd in words, how Eger she was, as
also when she took the Cup, it seemt as tho' She
thought it was the Last time that I shall enjoy it here
I will now take my fill, A few day before her Departure
her Cough Stop'd and She grew weaker, the Night
before her departuer She keept a very hearty band
with the Sister who watchd with her, and thank'd
her for all that which She had don for her, She now
alterd and one Coud see that her hour of Departuer
Drew Nigh, She Calld out very often for our Saviour
to fetch her, and not to Let her Stay to Long here, She
wou'd often Stretch out her Arme as if She Catchd at
something, saying O he is my dear Saviour He is my
dear Saviour, O Come my dearst Lamb, Come to
fetch me, take me into thy Armes, then She said
to her Sr Now I am satisfied, She said with wat art thou
Satisfied? She answerd with our Saviour he Lets me
fell his tender heart, and how much he loves me, ten
times more then I Could expect? She then feeling her
Self just redy for going, She sent for Sr Dorgy, She
thinking them not quick enough, Crid out pray Come
soon
When thay Came they began to Sing some Verses
Sutiable there to, but She however Recoverd again
and Lay quit still only Desiering the Sisters
to pray our Saviour that he would soon fetch, her
Which happend, about half an houer past Eleven in
the the forenoon, on the eleventh instant when her


Soul took flight into the Armes of her Eternal
Bridegroom under those words at he End of all her
Need, be her Unction wounds so red; grant her
to Lean unshaken &c. will She thy thy gental
Visag &c pail kiss her upon the heart,
Open Armes take her,
Under which words she recived the blessing
of her Choir, And she recived the last kiss
with such an inexpressable feeling, and on her
Countenenc was plainly to be seen the sweet impresh
ion of the Last Kiss, so that al around her
Could have wish for that blesst Lot
