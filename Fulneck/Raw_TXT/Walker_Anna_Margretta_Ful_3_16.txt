and many more which would be too tedeous to Mention
a year and half ago when a School was begun in the Sisr house
for the girls in the place, She Rejoised greatly there at
and has so much as her health wou'd admit of always gone
and it has been observd it has been special Blessing
to her, last Novembr She got a Fever which brought
her very weak but after wards Recovered prety well


Derectly after which she took the small pox, but came
very well thro, and was for a short time more healthy
than she used to be, and went in the School again, and
when any of the girls or Sisters went home and She
saw their Corps, it maid a great impresion upon her,
and she could not speak enough of their buty, and
often spoke how much She Longed to be like them
and tould some of her Companions that they should
come and see her when she was a Corps, and spoke
often with her father and Mother how they Should dress
her when she was a corps, and what she would
have in the coffin with her, but her greatest care
was about the watch word which was on her Birthday
for this year the Sisters in the School having writ of
her on apice of printed paper, when she Brought
it to her. Father, she said. I will have this put in 
my hands in the coffin with me,* She has complained
for these three Months last frequently of head ace, and
in pasion week She went one night to the meeting in 
the hall and Spoke with a peculiar delight of being
at great Sabbath and took care to have at her clothes
Clean for that day, but on Tusday in the night She
was shakon with a vilant pucking and headach


which Continualy increased, and altho' she took
medcin, yet neither that nor any thing els would
rest upon her Stomoc. So that it was plain that our dear
Saviour intended to take her into his Eternal Security
when She was askd at any time what she wanted she
always answred, I want our Saviour to come, when askd
if She would grow Better, She always said I will go to
our Saviour  and would hear of nothing als

So that we though She would Soon go home, but on the Monday
the doctor aplied something which gave her a little ease
till Friday night, when her convulitions Returnd again
So that one Expected her going home every houre, but She
still continued all that day and night, and Sunday having
Convultions continually, during the whole week
She was frecquantly visited by the Sisters both day and
night, which is hereby acknowledged with thankfulness
on Sunday in the night the convulsions left her and she 
Lay quite Still till half an hour past 5 on Monday morning
when her happy soul took flight into the wounds of her beloved
Saviour with the Blessing of the Cong and her choir aged 6 years
7 Months and 3 days


The text on her Birth Day was on the 20th of Sept
my flesh and my heart faileth, but god is the 
Strength of my heart, and my position for ever.
There's nought, that me can part from Jesus in
life or death vicissitude; I lay my hand in his side
precious and say, thou'st my Lord and my God."
The Srs observe as to her disposicon she was of a lively & acttive
turn though sometimes when her own will
showed it self it gave her and her Sisters some
trouble but when she was reminded of it she
soon was a sinner and beged us to forgive her
which we readyly did for she was tenderly beloved
by her Sisters and School companions
