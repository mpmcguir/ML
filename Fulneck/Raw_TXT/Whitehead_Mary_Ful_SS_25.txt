The course of Life of the SS Mary Whithead
I was born in streedside in the parish of Tong, May
10th 1737. My parents being presbns I was Baptz
& Educated the same religion, my father
departed This Life when I was 7 year old &
Left my dear mother with 7 Children to struggle
with the difficulties of Life in very much lower
Circumstances then she'd ever been us'd to
The Lord blesst Her chereful endeavours
for our suport, till such Times as we cou'd
Earn a little for ourselves.
about my 8 year I came into concern after
my salvation, & was much affected by reading
in the Scriptures which spoke of our Savrs
death & sufferings, ask'd my dear mother
what was the occasion, the resolv'd me in
the best manner was able she told me that Children was
sinful creatures as well as up grown people
& that we must learn to love God & not the evil
things of this world, I was much affected & Terified
when I did ought that was not right, & when
I see my Sister going to the Meetings I desired
to go with Her, but she refused me, however
I & some other Childrn ventured to the Meeting
which was kept at Richd Mortimers in Holm
Lane & Br Schleet sung the verse, dearest
Side Hole, I do covet thy warm blood above all things Viz
& spoke in the same manner over our Savrs death
& suffering as I had read, & said no one can be saved


without they become acquainted with the man Christ
Jesus, from this time I went constantly to the Meetings
& become I much noticed by Srs Rachel Walker, who
spoke with me about loveing the Lord Jesus, which
made a great impression on my mind. I was soon
received into the Children Choir & Cared for by Br &
Sister Helt & also went to the Children school kept
by the Single Sisters which was a great blessing
to my heart, from this Time I went on till my
13th year & on the Gr Girls Festival was received
into their choir, were a new schooling soon commenced.
My Spoilt & corrptd nature began to appear more
& more, & tho' I would willingly have been wholy
our dr Savrs yet in volantary to my self my
natural disposition wou'd have lead me into the
world, If strong conviction from the Holy Spirit
had not told me I shu'd be a mind & undone Creature
My Sinfulness & great deviation which I felt I kept
intirely from my Labourers, believing they neither
knew nor felt such things as I did; therefore
would reproach me that I wou'd not so love or be
our Savrs but thought I woul'd be more communicable
when all my Sinfulness was done away, I longed
with Earnest to be as acquaintd with My dear Savr &
have my sins forgiven, but nothing yet of this cou'd
I attain & in my 16 year I got the smallpox being
dangerously ill I was visitd by Sr Lorel Seidel
who who Labours amongest the Girls, she ask me
If I did not recover had I any asshurrance that
I was our dr Savrs, I told Her no, but I believed He
woud have Mercy on me & bring further acquaintd
with himself before be took me Hence, of this


Sickness I recoverd & retaind a true desire in my Heart
to become acquaintd, with My dear redeemer, yet
I was not without intervals of turning into the world
as I cou'd come to no realise in My Heart but since
have seen how thro grace & mercy I have been
preserved,
in the year 1757 I made known my desire to my
Labourer to be receivd into the congregation &
resolved to give my self up to our dearest Savr
as a spoilt poor creature as I was; without
waiting till I was better or Holy; with this impression
on My Mind that as I could not get myself freed'd
from Sinfulness He must take me as I am for I
cou'd wait no longer; I came to the Evening Meeting
at fulneck the first that Br Latrobe kept after
His arrival there, who sung, I'll weep when're thoust
not home Viz. & kept the discourse from the same
words, which made such an impression upon
me, that I become like wax before the fire,
in My returning home had the oppertunity to give
ful vent to my Crys enterd into a field there prostratd
with a Thousand tears before my Lambs feet
who gave me this Happy meeting, which has been
So momentious to me as never to be forgotten tho'
all my future course, for this End He had followed
& preservd me to Seal me as His own.
I returnd home, the rest & peace My soul injoyd
sufficed for that night without any other Slumber
to My Eyes & I was quite another Creature then before
& about 5 days after this I had the Grace July 20
to be received into the congregation this brought
a fresh concern upon me How I might use this


Grace according to the mind of my beloved, & tho' I
had Experienced that He had accepted of me
in the depth of my wretchedness & misery, yet
I wanted to please Him with myself Holiness &
prittyness of Heart rather then move as a
Sinful poor creature, in His presance
in the year 1758 I was received into the Srs Choir
in which I found I had many things to learn
I felt a real desire to come unto the Choirhouse
but as my mother, told me she shou'd not assist
me, & I feard the choirhouse Expencis wou'd be
more then I cou'd Earn by Spinning I was much
discouraged, but being wearied out by the daily
calls & convictions of my Heart, I came to such
a resolution that come Life or death I must venture
& was comforted by those words, seek the kingdom of
Heaven & all other things will be added,
augst. 18 1760 I injoyd the Great Grace to remove
into the Choir house, little Expecting the unhappyness
that did befall me, in this dear place I only
injoy 12 weeks of real cherefulness before a
most dangerous delution gaind deep Ground
in My Heart & mind, yea hourly the devils Craft
laid Such hold on me, that I reason'd over every
thing I heard or saw & thought If I got not speedaly
from the house I shou;d be destitute of every needful
clothing & I shou'd be oblige to go for real want
Moreover arts was not wanting to step in to
my assistance & under pretence of going to see
my mother, shou'd be the means I would make
use of, haveing Made a My Matters quite
compleat full of sly & craft I ventured of


when I had got about half way home I was all
at once Sized with such ap that I stood
quite still, Crying out aloud, Lord have Mercy
what have I done, many Questions pro; & con pulse
in My heart & Conscience, peter denny'd His Lord
but peter did not deceive His Brnn as I have
done My Sisters; pretending to Love them & had
nothing real at the bottom. & then comforting
my self that prehep I shou'd be happy with
my mother & sisters, who received me very Gladly 
past some time with an outward Brisk deportment
least any one Shoud see alook of pennitence or condemnation
which was all the while mixt with the Severest
cutting pain, thus I went on till Christmas &
at the night watch I took Courage to venture
with out leave into the Srs House, Trembling & frighten allmost
out of My Sencies, yet with an asumed boldness; all
who saw me viewd me as a Specture. Ann Birkby
was the first who came & spoke to me & askd me
how I cou'd think of entering this house after such
deceite as I had been Guilty of; Especial to the
Labourers before whom So Lately in My Classes
I had spoke so cherefuly & satisfied, as I did,
the truth of what she said reproach & smote my very
Heart & conscience; I felt my self as a criminal before
the place of Execution, got out of the house as fast as
ever I could, not reflecting it was night I hasten home,
my Eyes knew no rest for this night & several more, the
dreadful apprehenion of every moment being my Last
was Continnualy with me, those Eyes who as flames of
fire to the Guilty persue'd me were ever I went


in this deplorable situation I spent one whole week
then resolved to beg forgiveness of My Choir in write, for
without them I cou'd not bear My Life much longer
the contents of what I wrote move'd My dear Labouress
to send Sistrs to me the sight of which, Suprised
me beyond myself so that I could say very little
to them, they comfort me in My deep distress, & told me
If it was a realite in my Heart that I coud not live
with them, I had leave to come to all the opportunities
of the Soccitie Sisters, my thankfulness for this was
fare from being what it shou'd have been, for my
pride made a further claim but this I kept at
under all I cou'd, resolve'd to impertune My dearest
Lamb for through restoration of My happy
lott amongest the Sisters, & begd the favour to
Speak My self unto My Laboureres, the permission
of which had likd to have cost me very dear, the
Guilt & distraction of My mind sized me in such a
manner, that had not her friendly arm & bosom
been My Suport Id sunk down at Her feet, So is
Enough be comfortd, & feel we love you turn you to our
dr Savr, & If you cannot do be satisfied without
fellowship with us, you must only Seriously consider
that you must Expect to confirm, to the Circumstances
& regulations of our house & thro' Grace suit your
self to them, I coud from that moment have seald
it as with my Life that those things & I was but
once a gain within the house that they wou'd never
be any Molestation to my peace; Ah little did I
know,


what a poor weak Human Creature was daily yet to
appear in me, I return'd home but with a Heavy
Heart pour'd out my Living desires with Tears
to be forgiven by My Savr & His congregation & the
next day I felt the Grace to be a real pennitent in My
Heart & in the feeling sence of my Humility I found
it no hard Task to beg most Earnestly forgiveness of
my Choirs & the Congregation by writing without feeling any
right or worthyness at all, this was read in the Conference
& on the following Sunday the Joyful Tidings was
imparted that I had leave to come again into the
Choirhouse, this Humbled me into the very dust before
My dearest Savr & on April 7th 1761 I had the Grace
be received in the midst of my Choir within
as humane of there love by my dr Srs many who told
me that all former things should be quite forgotten
& forgiven, kiss me recomm'd me the to the Heart of
of My beloved Savr thus I was blesst for a new beginning
but a lass I misst the path for My Joy & thankful
ness soon abated & I began to doubt over the
Sisters not loveing me as they did one another
My unsinnerlike way of thinking hear brought
me into abstructedness of every kind & great dry
ness of Heart inso much that I felt my self like
fish out of water, all which I kep intirely to my
self thinking I should never more prosper in
this Time, & tho' I had so Lately felt what it was
to be Seperatd from the fellowship of my Choir
yet My pride look for more Complacency from
the Sisters, which my foregeget [Vorsteherin] told me then I


merited or deserved, this reprove brought me
more upon My heart then ought I had meet
with & I plainly see the fault lay intirely in
my self, I became more Sinnerlike & humble
& then love & mercy pourd in upon me & my
Gracious Lord gave me leave to become a
candidate for the Holy Sacrement Nov 20th
1761 & on March 13th 1762 I had the Grace
to become a participant of the Holy Corpses
& blood which put much to shame & also the
gracious promise of the w w, of the day. I will
make an End of all thy Morning & days of Joy
shall begin.
May the following I was direct'd to keep the
Childrns School in the Country first Mirfield &
then wyke which did not comprise very long; by this appearently
I had many things to learn & got a daily insight 
of short falling, but was thankful to injoy rest
& peace again in My dr Choirhouse were Id not
been Long before before I was took with an intemit
ing fever to gather with my Scurbile disorder that
came on me Spring & fall, which occasion me
13 week Sickness in the Sickroom which was no
small blessing to my heart He provd Himself
my all in all Circumstance in My course the dependant
situation I was often brought into thro' Sickness &
other Occasion was very Contrary to My disposition
but My Savr provd it needful & wholesome for me
tho' it caused me many an heavy hour, to be thus
burdensome to My dear Choir.


the repeated sickness of our Happyly departed Sister caused
Her many reflections of the last mention'd kind, as
her natural Tendency was not to be burthemsom
she applied herself industriously on all occasion that
she might maintain herself, but our dr Lord who
know the disposition of Her mind used all possable
means to indear Himself unto Her heart as the
only object to be depended on, she was very ???
of Her own depravity, & the Inclination to Serve or
do Something for our Savr was at Times such a fine as
Her
Carry'd beyond the Sinnerpoint & injoyment of her
wounded friend: this impatient ambition caus'd
Her many perplexing Moments, which our Drst
Lord had to comfort Her very often about.
3 months ago, Her former disorder fell upon Her
Stomach & early vorlent reachings which occasiond
Her moveing into the Sickroom from the Grt Girls
whom she had served with great faithfulness
Dureing the short time she was with them
when in the sickroom it was Soon perceiveable that
our dearest Savr intend by this Sickiness to finish
Her Course in this Time, but she did not believe
it, till Her bodily weakness increased so fast, that
she often cal'd out to Her deavest Bridegroom to
prepare Her Speedily for His arms & bosom as a poor
needy Sinner who thro' the merits of His wounds
that She might enter into her eternal rest.
She often with the greatert earnestness wou'd Express
how happy it was to have a recconsil'd Heart & no
other desires then to wait with patience those redeemers will


& to retain a true & lively sense of all the Grace bestowd
upon one Especialy in Such hours & moments when
the bodily pains pours in beyond all patience, a few
days before Her departure she askd the Sister If they
thought or know of ought that cou'd detain Her
she thought she had nothing on Her Mind, but
what she had throughly spoke about with Her
Hearts best freind, but she was answerd by a Sr
that patience & resignation with a longing spirit
after Him is of Happy Consequence to a Soul thats
waiting for His comeing, she paus'd a little &
then said. Ah that is it, He alone can give me
patience, tho' I want to be with Him yet Ill wait
His Time, Her longing increase every moment
& Her great pain which had infeeababled Her
dying bones grew more bearable & on the
29 of June between the hours of 11 & 12 in the
night she fell softly & Happyly asleep, thus
Closed Her Course haveing spent 32 years
& some days in this Time
