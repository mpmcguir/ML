I was Born in Gloslop Parish near Hayfeld in Darbisher Aprell
ye 6 1729 My Parints being Church pepell & endevered to being us up
for the Lord and endeverd to keep us from worly Company as far as they
Could, My Mother ust often tell us of our Sav, at the time when I got the Smallpox
I was so ill that I was given up by the Doctor my father asked me if I could
Like to go to our Sav I Sade yes for I felt Somthing of our Savs love in my
Heart, but I soon recovered again, In the year 1732 David Talor Came
about a preaching My Father and mother went to hear him & took me
with them which I liked soon after Mr Inrom came his preaching I liked
Still better for I now felt that I wanted somthing for my Heart, In a short
time after ye Brethen came and Settell a Laity at our House which gave us
an oppertunity to speak to them about our Hearts which often proved a Comfort
and Consolation to me at that time, in ye year 1736 I Came the first time to
Yorkhir I had the pleasur of geting Acquainted with Some of ye Sisters they took
me to the econimy in pudsy for a few Days were I had some Conversation with
Ann Burkbe & Sis Clacket the latter asked me if I was Resolved to be our Sav &
live for him I told her that it was my whole intention so to do She spoke to me of
our Sav, love to poor Sinners which made a deep impression on my heart
the fellowship which I injoyed with ye Sisters & Blessed feeling I had of the place
made me think that Lambshill was a heaven upon earth which Caused me much
pain to Leave it, Some day after I got to my father I begun to grow more and
more unesy & distress in my mind I ust to go by myself into the feld and prayed
our Sav, that he would let me feell his Grace as I found that I had no lasting
satisfaction in any thing but our Sav was pleased to draw nigh to my Heart which
proved a real comfort to me thus I went on for Some time in a Chearfull
way being our Sav to preserve me from day to day for I felt that in myself I was
a poor and good for nothing Creater, when Bro & Sis Heakerwelder Came to
Care for the plan in Duckinfeild I gained much Confidence to them both &
Could Acquaint them with every thing which opprest my mind, in ye year 1748 our Sav
was pleased to Call my Mother to himself which went very near me for I loved
her exceedingly she comforted us in the Best Manner and Assured us that our
Sav and his dear Congreation would know Better how to Care for us then She had
done her last words were I am quite Ready to go to my dearist Bridegroom
which had a very Blessed effect on my Mind from this time on I felt a real
Desire in my heart to become a member of the Congreation in ye year 50 on
ye 13 of June our Sav granted me my Requste to be Reciveed which unexpected
Grace and faviour bowed me in the dust at the feet of my Dearist Bridegroom
In the same year I was made a Candiate for the holy Sacreament and was
confirmed at Christmas which Grace I cannot express in words but my being
So far a distance from the Congreation delayed my going to the Communing for
Sometime Longer it however brought me into a Close and Strick exsamanation
in my own heart and one Day as I was walking alone by myself in the feilds
Medeatating what a grate matter it was to go to the holy Sacreament and that no
one Could Injoy it right but such as Could know that there Sins was


Forgiven them by our Sav and thou Hearts washed in his Blood, but I
found that it was not so with me it brought me into great perplexity of
mine which I strove to hide from my Father & Sis, I felt a great inclination
to be allways by myself Sometimes thoughts would arise in my Mind as if
our Sav did not like to have any thing to do with me; my Misry daly increased
so that I thought that I Should never come thro feeling very much destress
In my Soul I retired into a room were I prostrated and prayed our dear
Saviour that he would be pleased to Manifest himself to my poor Heart
in that figure were in for all my Need he did die on the Cross for poor me
I was Cheared & Comforted by the greatious Absolutison which I Recved as a
poor pardon Sinner which Melted me like wax before my only Machless
Heart whose thro bored feet I kiss and weted with many a thankfull Tear
beging that he would keep me as a poor Child that had no dependance but
on him alone in ye year 1751 Aprell 16 I had the unspeakabell
Grace and faviour to pertake for the First time of our Sav Corps &
Blood in the holy Commuion which day I Shall never forget it was
to me as if our Sav was Bodly present in the Congreation, I retured
home again with a Heart throly thankfull for what I had injoyed
But being Convinced in my own heart that I was not as yet in that pleace
which our Sav had called me too My desive to live with the Sis grew more &
more stronge and after Coming again to Yorkshir I Spoke to Sis Mary about
Coming to live with the Sisters in the econimy but she desired me to be
Sattisfyed till Surcumstance would make it so that and My Sis Ester Could
Both Could Come at a time and assured me that we should not be unforgoten
but Cared for as well as if we lived amongst them, in the same year it was
thought well by the Brethen for my father to be Married again which gave
me and My Sis some hope of our going to live at lambshill, we Both made
our desire known to Sis Mary in wrighten and got leave to Come as soon as
we Could make it possabell in ye year 1752 in September the long wished for
time came when Both I and My Sis came to live with the Sisters in the
Econimy were we was Reced amongst them with much love which put us
quite to Shame Sis Mary acquainted me that my Sis would stay in the ecominy
at lambshill and for me to go to that ecominy at the tiersellhall which I felt to
be quite sattifed with I soon found myself at home amongst them and
injoyed much Grace and happiness in that place when the quire house
was Finished I amonget the rest got leave to move into it which I
esteemed a grate Grace and faviour for which I could never be thankfull
Enofe to our dear Sav for I beged My dearist Bridegroom very tenderly
that he world make me a obbedent good Child according to his heart and
mind So that he could obtain his full aime with me in every respect for I
felt that it was a new Scoul for my heart werein I had much to Larn


everyday what poor Creater I was in myself and in how much need I stood of our
Sav reaching in my heart being Masterly of a Close dispositson and unremovable
In my own way of thinking and lacking the occation that the Sister was after obblige
to reprove me which I did not take well of them alltho I Spoke as littell against it
as posiabell yet in my heart I had not that true Sinnerlike feeling which I
beleved that the rest of my Sisters did injoy and on account of this I felt often
unesy and keept many a hearty Band with my Best beloved friend which was
pleased to Show me my falts by Name and comforted me about it in a unspea
kabell Mannar 
I soon began to grow Sickly got a pain in my Side and by a Rumactket dissoder in my Back
was rended in some Measure unabell for my work which Caused a Certain
Fretfullness in my mind all posiabell means was used to get me some help
yet to very lettell efect Sis Mary advised me to go for a short time home to my
Father to see if the Change of the air would do me good but after a true
consideration about it I found no liberty in my heart for it I therefore beged
to be excuse as I had the assurance from our Sav that I was in the right pleace
which he had alloted for me I did address myself to the freind of poor needy
Sinners and prayed him to stand by me and help me thro tell he had prepared me
for himself in ye year 1753 when Anna Jona pade a viset in Yorkshire She
Spoke to all the Sisters and I had likewise had the Sattifaction to keep a hearty Band with
her which proved a grate Blessing for my heart, in the year 1754 to we had the pleasure
and satifaction to see our dear Papar & Mamaen amongst we which happy and Blessed
time will never be forgoten by me and what I felt and injoyed at that cause most memorabell
Choir Sacrament and foot washing, cant express in Words O how was I struck when was made
acquainted that I was to be one of that number I could hardly contain for Shame
and thankfullness to think that our Sav Should Chuse me one of the poorist and the 
unworthist of them all I devoted myself anew to the Bridegroom of my Soul to live for
him in this world and I will kiss his bored Feet in Eternity for all what I
have injoyed from him when I look back and consider the Manifold Graces and
Blessings which he has been pleased to bestow on me the poorist of all and yea what
Love and patiance he has shown to his poor helpless Child it bows me in the dust with
a heart full of Gratitude and my whole wish is to keep my eye fixt upon his Marterd
Pirson so that nothing May come betwen him and me. So far her own words
Our haply Departed Sis was In Ganrall of a still & quiet disposion one
that never made much show with what our Sav did intrust her with
but past on her time in a Childlike and happy Mannar Reling as a
poor sinner on her hearts Best freind to whome She had devoted her self
with Soul & Body to become an intire Joy to him and his dear Congreation
She often spoke to her Labours with an only tender feeling about the injoyment
of the Choir and Choir Grace and what She had felt and experance in her own


Heart yay and how much Her Dearist Bridegroom had done on her from 
time to time her parisabell in Regard to orders & Regulations in a Choir
House were such as affords Sattion to moste of the Sister that knew her
be a honest Heart She had the ofred commited to her to be a helper in
a Room of Sisters werein she asked with all faihfullness according to
the Grace which She had Recved but as her poor State of health rendered
her unabell for going much about which it gave her In the begin a Good
deall of Consarn that she Could not lend that Assistance to her Sisters which
She know was her Duti to do and moreover instead of that she could not
think her self to be trobellsome to them but however be there Love
and kindness towards her she often was quite but to shame her Close
attachment to Sav as likewise to her Choir made her very Chearfull
& Contented to evry Sisters admiration when She at times was Left alone
in a Room by her self which happened very often when all the Sisters
went to the Meetings she ust to say when I am thus left by my self
