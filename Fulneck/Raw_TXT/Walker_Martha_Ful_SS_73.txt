Some particulars of the life of the late Sing. Sisr
Martha Walker, written by herself.
I was Born Decr 12th. 1725 at Cheadly Home in ye Parish
of Stockport Chesher and Bap'd in ye Church of England, but brought up a
Presbn to which religion persuasion my Mother belong'd as I don't remember
 any thing particular of my Chilns years, I shall pass over that time
without saying any thing of it of that time till I came into my 16th year about which
time I left my Father's House & went to service when not long soon after my
Father dep'd this life leaving my Mother with Five Chiln of whom
I was oldest, and being naturally of a thinking Disposition I was brought
into great perplexity of mind, and one day being exceedingly distress'd about
not comprehending what wou'd become of us, that Text of 
Scripture darted so powerfully into my Mind I will be a Father
to ye Fatherless & a friend to ye Widow Ps 68.5 that I was comforted
yea and all my needless concern was was directly dissipated believing at ye same
time most positively that ye Lord changeth not, but what he saieth is yea
and Amen In my 17th year circumstances requir'd it that I chang'd
my place which was exceedingly alone when and I enter'd into service in a
farmers house in my own native place, which it was in this year that at the time when Mr
Ingham & Mr Taylor came into these parts to preach ye Gosple, which being
soon nois'd about, I with many many more went out of curiosity to hear
I see wherein these Preachers differ'd from the generallity of other People, not
understanding the meaning thereoff, but I was soon brought thereby to most
serious and concern'd reflections about my miserable and lost conditon by
nature, which I saw & feelt so plain that I was at once convinc'd, that if Jesus.
did not save me I was undone forever and tho' I now believ'd ye Minister's
Testimony that Jesus came into ye world to bleed and die in order to save
Sinners yet ye World and its vanity at times got the uper hand appearing
to me in most butiful and lively Colours for as such I then thought them to be,
and engag'd my heart and mind so at times that they had certainly prov'd Master


had not my kind Shepheard himself who had already Chosen me for his property him
self became the Conquerer, for after spending thus far of my life in ignorance
way with regard to ye happiness to be enjoy'd in Christ Jesus, and a as a Sinner in
sinfulness, I was under  Mr lngham's preaching on the words now then we are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in
Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to god Cor. v. 20 brought more particularly to ye (understand the) reality
of the matter in myself, wanting no other peace and seeking none else and when as he repeated
the words: Christ is reconciled to you, I pray'd most sincerly to ye Lord to let me ex
perience ye reallity of this grand truth in my heart with ye and I received the possitive assurance that I 
was excepted by him, and I went home with a deep sense of my fallen condition
but at the same time rejoic'd at ye preciousness of Salvation in Christ Jesus, which
I believed to be attainted too, tho' as yet I had not experience'd it fully for myself, but
was sincerely desirous after the same, and ye next day following ye Lord my God
and Saviour made himself known to my heart, in that form wherein for all my
need he underjustise rigor once on ye Cross didn't bleed. I shall not attempt to explain
or describe, what I then felt and enjoy'd, as this might only serve to marr what concerns
the most important time of my life, from which time I date my happiness both in
time and to unendless etternity, and as this is better understood by experience
then explination, by every one who can say with me. Now no more I strive in vain
Jesus Christ has wone my heart, First my thoughts and free from pain In his
death. I have a part &c. I shall say no more about this important period but that it was
in my 18th year when I was in the greatest danger and feelt more of my depraved
nature then at any other time in my Life, This put a stop to my running headlong into many
foolish erro's which otherwise my natural inclinations wou'd have led me to, but as I in
some measure felt a liking for what I thought concerned not Christ I begun to under
stand ye Lord's will was not mine will was not mine now and I frequently pray'd to him since he had confered
ye greatest of blessings upon me, in forgiving me my Sins also to make known his mind
to me with regard to perticulars which were was a disturbance to me in my enjoyment of him
and entierly to set me at liberty from all but everything that so I might have him alone, and as I found this requir'd a
true resignation to his will, this became a matter of concern with to me praying the Lord frequent
to hear and help me, and since I knew I was his, I durst not do any thing of myself
tho' I often had the greatest inclination there to, but ye Lords hand was over me in a
most particular manner, which I have been more sensible off since then at that time, and according
to my petition so it was with me, for I soon found myself intierly set at liberty from everything all by


my dear. Saviour understanding he had thoughts of peace over me, after which time
I went on in an uninterrupted intercourse with him my best friend, who was become
my dearest and nearest object in the midst of the World. I then join'd Mr
Taylor's Society, but a disagreable circumstance happen'd to him which was were the
occasion of his leaving us, & ye means of Br Ockerhousen's coming into these
parts in order to settle a regular Society of which I was one & frequented the preach
ing at Duckenfield as often as possible, and in 1748 according to my request
I went to live with ye S. Srs at Duckenfield to which I had a particular call
in my heart from our dear Saviour, & being quite clear in my call I spent
my time chearful and happy. In ye year 1750 I came with 9 more Srs
to live in Tiresall Oeconomy here in Yorkshire and during my stay there I was
recd into ye Congn & became Spectator of ye holy comunion which both was
very weighty to me. In Decr 1752 I movd with some more to Fulneck
in order to begin the Choir-house where I've spent ye remainder part of my
life. In april following I became partaker of ye holy Sacrament with this
Congn which grace was recd by me with a deep sencibility of my unworthiness
which made me very timerous about myself Concerning the same but I was strengthened
by my dear Saviours owning & Comforting me thereby to my great a
basement, so that thro' his grace I have been enabled to partake thereoff every
since when ever this Congn on our Choir has been privilidg'd have been favored with the enjoyment
thereof, to my real strength and help thro' this vale of Tears: and my heart
rejoices when ever its approach the time for it draweth nigh, and it was I to rehearse only
some parts of the particulars of my course, relative to the internal matter since I came
into this house it wou'd at make the description of it too long, therefore, I shall leave it with only asking
the following concerning what the Lord his done on my Soul. I sought him, &
found him, while he drew me with the cords of his love & has overcome me so
far that I am made one Spirit with him, never more to part to an endless
Eternity what I have experience'd in the enjoyment of him from time to time
and how I have been instructed by his faithful Schooling in ye knowledge of
my deep depravity & nothingness, in stillness, will be matter of thanks & praise with


Martha Walker
Our late dear Sister has in the above given a faith
ful & true account of her course thro' time. She was
an humble simple devoted Soul; & counted it a privilege to 
serve our Savior whenever it was in her power. She
has been 45 Years a very faithful Sickwaiter in
the Single Sisters house here, during which time She
has attended the 145 Sisters, who have departed to our
Savior. In her office She was truly disinterested.
impartial, tender to everyone, patient and loving;
so that all both those who have departed under her care, &
who have recoverd, always spoke of her with the greatest
regard, and her memory venerable among us.
She remained in the Sickroom as long as she was
able, till in this seven Months before her departure. She
being troubled with a complaint in her leg, in which She 
sufferd much pain, she beged leave to retire from her 
office, & she spent her time amidst all her suffering
chearfully & happily, in hopes of soon seeing her Savior.


Her complaint towards the close of her life became
still more extensive spread exceedingly; a mortifi
cation having taken place. But amidst all, she was
exceedingly patient, & ardently longing to be at home
with the Lord. One night, shortly before her end, She
desired that her Choirhelper might be called; to whom
when she came, she said, that she wished to tell
her, how unspeakably happy she was, & how near
she felt our Savr, so that the could almost forget
her bodily pain. In this happy state she continued
till at pleased our Lord, on the 22nd of Jany to receive
her redeemed Soul, which when * she fell gently & hap
pily asleep in the 75 66th Year of her age.
* having recd the blessing of her Choir


and we must give her testimony that she lived in a near
Connexion with our Savior, and knew herself as a Sinner
often said She was the poorest Creature our Savior could
have chosen, but was very thankful for her happy Lot
of Grace, the Srs Sometimes wou'd tell her how well She
might have had it in the world, She always said what
would that have been to me it I had never known my Savr
he is of more worth to me than all this world can give.
towards the latter end of her life She was very often Speaking
of the goodness of our Savior as she frequlently had very
bad rest in the Night she wou'd say in the Morning how near our
savior had heart to her, and that she cou'd tell him every thing


and that it was impossible to tell how kind he was to her
he had never done her any thing but good on Our Last
festival when She with the other sick Srs had her share
of the Holy Comn brought to her, she was remarkably
Cheerful and spoke afterwards of the grace she had enjoy'd
and how near our Savior had been to her, She had, had several
bad nights but no one thought her end so near, or the 6 in
the Night she was taken very Ill and in the Morning
the Doctor went to see her who told her the wou'd not live
long, She was to delighted at the thought of it that She
cou'd not express her Joy, her Breath was so bad that She
cou'd not keep her bed but was oblig'd to sit up day & night
