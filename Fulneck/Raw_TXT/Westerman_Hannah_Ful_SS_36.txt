Hannah Westerman born at Oset near Dewsbury June
13th 1716. I had from my Infancy a particular concern about
my Salvation & about my 12 I felt strong convictions upon
me & was particularly affected and as the preaching of
the parish Minister Concerning the wickedness & Sinfullness
of the human race, on the same day thro' real anxiety
of mind I proswaded my br tho younger then My self to walk
with me in the fields, to whom I declared with many tears
My concern of mind about not knowing that I shoud be
saved which was the Cause of Many Melancholy reflections
which my parents & acquaintances have to devert me from
& took to the deversion of with other young people in a natural world
way not with convicion all the time, at Last resolve to go to
Service to void the influence of my acquaintance & to live more
to my hearts satisfactory Consideration. about my 18 year I had a voilent
illness in which I felt powerfull conviction of my own sinfullness
which Continue a Longing with me this unhappy, once this unhappy Life & my unhappy situation I bemoan with Many tears & prayed
unto the Lord to help me being told Mr Ingham kept meetings for
all such people who wanted to hear how they Might be saved & I with
trimbling heart went to hear a little for myself not presumeing to
make my self publick & among such sort of good people feeling My own
wretchedness in such a palpable manner I was much discouraged hereby
but Mr Ingham took notice & inquired after me by his Sistr who told him
I was under great concern of mind. the next day I went to speak with
him, he askd many Questions Concerning My coming to the knowledge
of my own wretchedness, or if I had committed any Gross sins which
had Voilently affected me I answerd no, he also askd If I had ever
received the Sacrement I told him no I dost not presume to any
such thing, her preswaded me to persevere & trust in the Lord
& go with him to the next Sacrement, after which I felt a


a little eaiser in my Mind, but no real comfort of heart
or knowledg that my Sins was forgiven, Mr. Ingham
being calld away I & several single women was Left
in the Care of his sistr & on Mr Inghams return I went
to be a Servant in his family, at which time Mr Ingham
acquainted us concerning the Brn who was cald Moravians
they having a More Experemeital knowledg in the sufferings of
Christ, then what he cou'd possabley speak about. in the
year 41 Br TÃ¶ltschig was the first who arrived, him
whom Mr Ingham desired woud keep a meeting, Br Toltschig
sung: this verse: ye hearts of stone, come Melt & see Viz.
which made such an impression on my heart as if wrote
by the hand of the Eternal Son of God, when the meeting
was over Br Toltschig inquired who I was, Mr Ingham
told Him I was his servant & one whom he might speak
with at any time, the next day I injoyd that unexpected Grace
to My Unexpressable shame & deep humiliation, for I thought he
was surely like an angle of God who knew the Secrets of my
in most Soul, & to whom I left nothing undisscovered, & from
that time cou'd always unbosom the most Minute Circumstance
of my heart situation, after this I continued pritty Cherefull
but not wholey satisfied, some time after I was walking a
lone being much depressed in My Mind, I was particularly
depress affect with a divine impression in My Mind which that
caused such an Emotion of heart as made me with great
vemence cry out My Lord & My God, & the visiable aspect
of him who had sufferd, death for on the Cross for my sins stood before
my heart, the Effects of which was an abideing Grace


& some little time after it begun to clear to her
mind, that Our dr Savr prehaps intend soon to take
her to himself this made her more resign but upon
some small apperance of her being better she begun to
fear, that all these hopes must vanish but this
continued not long her dissorder give Evident proof
of a real Cousumption & tho of this slowest kind yet
so bore it she was Strength'd by the Grace & nearness
of her dearest Savr to wait with becomeing patience
her apointed Time & with Childlikeness continued
to deport her self with all thankfullness heart for all the
nurssing Care wch was bestowd upon her & gave a
real Testemonie of respectable behaviour to her
Sistr & sick waiter in the room & Evidence a particular
nearness of the person of her nearest Bridegroom
& at the enjoyment of her our dr Lords Corpres & blood
She felt a particular sinnerlike thankfullness of
heart, & at the departure of one of her sick companions
namely hannah westerman she was who had the
Grace to Enter into her happy rest the first she particularly
desired her her to use her intresst wch our Savr in here
poor behalf that She might soon be Summons home
to him with many tender tears their parting was
be desired. She from this Time was visably seen to
after, & at our fest when visitd by Sisr Mary she
seam to feel her Time wou'd not be Long & was
under some concern of Mind for feard Sist Mary would
be so fully Occupied in this day of Grace that she
would scarce have time to give her the Last unction of
her Choir but so it was Made out between her Lord
& she, that her hour shoud strike at the Closeing of
of this blessed day & about 4 a Clock in the Morning  her
Spirit took flight into the Arms of her beloved under the
singing of those words


her Class had wth her a Lovefeast in the
Sickroom wch was a particular favour
to her
