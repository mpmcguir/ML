The S. Sr Hannah Wilkinson was
born in Gadley near Hallifax Feb. 22d
1755, and baptized in the Church
of England. As an infant she moved
with her Parents to Huddersfield.
She often ralated with pleasure, that
when she was but a young Child
her Mother used to take her to
Church to hear Mr Veen, an awake
end Minister, which often proved
a great blessing to her, particularly
as her Mother who was under serious
concern for herself, & her Children would
often afterwards speak to her on
the subject which the Minister had
treated on, and admonish her not to
be wild and thoughtless because
the Lord would then have nothing
to do with her, this often struck
her much, and made her pray to
the Lord to form her according to
his mind. After some time her
Mother & she her began to attend the 
Preachings & meetings of the Brn
held in Huddersfield; from the 


very first time, it was impressed on
her mind, that this was the people
she belonged to, and tho' her Father
did not approve of it, yet nothing
could hinder her. In the year 1767
she came the first time to Fulneck
with a company of great girls to
their Festival, she was so much pleas'd
with this day & the blessings she
injoyed, that she had no rest
till she obtained leave to live a
mongst us the Srs, this favour was granted
to her the following year, when she
went to live in the Srs House
at that time in Little more. She
often spoke with pleasure of the
happy time she spent there, in her
Childlike simplicity, which was
truly blessed to her. In Aug. 1771
she came to live in the Srs House
here in Fulnek now a new period
commenced, she began to feel her
sinful state by nature, her confi
dence in our Saviour, and her former
simplicity was lost, this brought


her into great trouble, she searched her
heart and wished to see herself in
the same light as our Saviour saw 
her, and also to appear so, but
this proved a great struggle to her.
However our Saviour gave her grace 
freely to open her mind, which prov
ed a great comfort and incougage
ment to her, and being assured that
our Saviour received sinners, and un
derstands all our human weaknesses,
her confidence in him was strenthe
ned enew, she turned to him with
a contrite heart, and sought and
found the forgiveness of her sins in
his precious blood, and prayed for
his sanctifiing grace to help her thro'
in her future course. May 4th 1772
she was recd into the S. Srs Choir
with 16 other great girls, this was
to her a day of mourning & blessing
it was a day of sollem solemn sur
render of heart to our Saviour, that
his aim and thoughts of pease may


fully be obtained with her, many sighs
and tears an this occation went up
to the throne of grace, which in mercy
were owned by him. Soon after this
day, she with 8 other young Srs of
the said company met together in
in the Wood, and covenanted with 
each other to live to the Lord, and 
if they saw any thing in each other,
that their walk and conversation
was not according to our Saviours
mind, to speak in love to one an
other without restraint. They all Kept
faithful to the Lord, and their pro
miss except One, which she often
greatly lamented. Oct 6th 1773
she was recd into the Congn and
Feb. 4th 1775, she partook for the
first time of the H. Comn.
After the new built Sr House in
Wyke was compleated, she went 
in Aug 1783 as Room overseer with
9 Srs to inhabit it, here she ex
perienced many trials of various Kind,
but our Saviour gave her grace to


put her trust and confidence in him;
she was of a chearful & lively temper
always willing to encourage others &
to derect them to our Saviour, par
ticularly the young Srs committed to 
her care, found in her a real friend.
She was a faithful visitor to the 
sick both in and out of our circle;
and as it was her delight & pleasure
to converse with her friends, concer
ning our Saviours leading with her
and them, such visits was often
attended with great blessing.
On account of a sickly habit and
some other circumstances; she wished
to move again to Fulnek, this re
quest was granted to her May 23d 1803,
after spending nearly 20 years in the 
Srs House in Wyke, where she was
useful and beloved. The rejoycd
at being again in Fulnek, which she
looked upon as her proper home,
and often said: "I am now in
my resting place, where I shall
end my days; when my Saviour pleases."


Of late years she was much troubled
with Cramp & Rheumatism, but she
bore it patiently, allways saying with
a chearful heart, she had much more
reason to be thankful then to
complain, when she called to mind
our Saviours help & support which
she dayly felt. About 3 weeks be
fore her departure she was seized
with uncommen headake & sickness
which never left her. It troubled
her sometimes being afraid of loosing
her senses. Her afflictions was great.
On the 3d of Sept she said with
faltering voice; "I am in our Saviours
hand, he must do with me as he 
pleases; I am perfectly resigned to
his will, & tho I have no particular
clearness if I shall go to him on
this occation or recover again, yet
I am asured he will receive me
in mercy. What heav'nly hope joy and
exulation this hope afforts unto
my heart. Then in his presence 


I for every with the redeem'd shall 
sing his praise O Lord I long
to have that favour to leave this
world and see thy face."
From this time she could not speak
any more to be rightly understood,
neither could she hear nor take
note of any thing, with foldet hands
and broken word she prayed to our
Saviour. The 7th in the morning 
it pleased him to release her from
all suffering in a happy & gentle
manner in the 55th year of her age.
