Mary Athill died July / 46
Born with twin Sr. Sarah in Antigua 18
July 9 / 14. came to Britn in 1821 first 
to Edinbro', then to Fuln. Sch with elder
Sr. Esther; remained here till Octr. / 28, when 
went first to London, where confirmd in 
ch of Engld in 1829 went back to Antigua
where remd till / 36; after residence of
5 yrs in Lond came to live in Srs house
here in / 41. Admitted comt members
in summer / 43.
In the course of last year certain circum
stances occurred, which convinced our late
Sr., in a painful manner, but most affec
tually of the emptiness & deceitfulness of
this world; & shewed her that, however se re
cluded mote from worldly vanity & pleasure
our settlements may be, they are at the
same time screened from much evil,
& unvisited by many & placing
my bitter & heart rending cares & sor
rows; & that true place & lasting en
joyment are to be found only in the
ways of genuine piety; in a word, that
"godliness with contentment" is great
gain. The consequence was that,
after on returning, after an absence of
about 8 mos. to our Srs' house & to the
church of the Brn. she evidently lived
in much more comfort than before,
set a higher value on her privileges,
temporal & spiritual, seemed to enjoy
the means of grace, & grew, we trust
in the inner way, in knowledge & 
in grace.
Her health was always delicate, & in
the course of last Winter, began to fail
more & more, so that, in spring, fears began


to be entertained of the result. In
May June last month she went to Burlington to try the
effect of the sea-air; but all was in vain, &
she returned in abt. a fortnight for
weaker than when she left us. About a week After
her arrival here, however, she seemed to
rally very much so that we began to che
rish hopes of her eventual recovery; but she
soon sank again, & very rapidly; & a
physician being called in, at once de
clared that there was not a shadow of
hope. It fell to my lot to inform our
late sister of this, which I did in as gentle
a manner as I could devise. From the
commencement of her illness, she had
expressed a very great anxiety to recover;
& tho' she seemed aware how well
founded were the many hints were her
of the danger of her case, & of the necessity
of preparing to meet her God, & that she 
certainly did not neglect the one thing
needful, yet she flattered herself with 
hopes of recovery getting better & clung to life, until 
the interview I had with her above allu
ded to & which took place in the evening
of 8th, the day before her birthday. She
certainly seemed both alarmed & distressed
when she at length learned there was no
hope; but she listened most eagerly, & I
believe, with childlike faith, to my ear
nest adminitions, to turn to Jesus, the 
Savr. from sin & deathl & also to the encou
ragements I endeavoured to give her, by 
pourtraying in scripture-phrase, the
infinite compassion & tender mercy
of that Savr., his readiness to pardon
& receive every one that believeth. X
Before this period she had often been hard
X as well as to the fervent I offered up by her side


praying very fervently in the night. ???
for acceptance in the Beloved for pardon,
peace, santification & redepemtion. 
From the day just now mentioned,
July 8th I found her, at each subse
quent visit, more & more composed,
her light & peace of mind continually
increasing; she was evidently delighted
to hear of Jesus, & to listen to the prayers
offered up on her behalf & was, no doubt,
very grateful to her choir-labourer & 
other friends for all spiritual advice & en
couragement given her as well as for other proofs
of kindness & various attentions.
I saw her last on Saturday 18th visit
about noon; she then told me, that she
felt quite happy & had no fear of death
because she was persuaded that, tho' she
knew herself to be a poor miserable
sinner, her Savr. had pardoned her blotted
out all her sins, & would receive her
in mercy to himself. In this peace
ful frame she continued until 5
o'clock on Sunday morning, when after 
having suffered some violent convul
sions, she fell asleep in Jesus, aged
32 years.
Our last Sister's conduct was gene
rally speaking regular, strictly moral,
& marked generally speaking, by
uprightness & conscientiousness.
Yet we will not deny that there were
not many decided manifestations in
her character, of spiritual life, until
her last illness. the good Providence
of God led her last year thro' heavy trials, which
ever bless for her instruction in
righteousness, & prepared her we believe,


for those life-giving operations of His
spirit, which finally issued contract
& believe in her full salvation, & in her
being needs meet for the inheritance
of the saints in light. May the
Lord be the consolation & support of
her surviving twin sister & give her
both her & all our young members
yea of all us grace. to give diligence
to make our calling & election sure, 
& to work while it is called to day
seeing the night cometh, in which no
man can work.
