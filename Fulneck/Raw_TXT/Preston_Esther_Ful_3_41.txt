Esther Preston, who went to our Savr on Febry the 22 1771
was born at Kirkheaton Ap 8 1719, of Ch Engl Parrents

When about 4 years old I asked my Parrents to take me with
them to Church, which they promised me Soon, having asked my
mother what the Church was, She told me it was Gods House,
which made me verry desirous of being there, in somuch that
my Parrents being from home, I desir 'd to be carry' d in a

obtain the favour & love of God, yet this afforded me no real
Satisfaction, I thought if my Companions where but of one mind

dear to me made it verry difficult to me, on the other had

Concerning my self as I narrowly escaped being drowned 3 times
but was providentially preserved, after which time I could no
longer in any of my former amusements or Company, find any
Pleasure or Satisfaction, but was Continualy uneasy in my mind
