Fulneck April 11th 1868.
My dear Br. Clemens,
I first I am unable,
at present, to draw up a proper
Memoir of my dear departed
wife. All I can do is
merely to offer a few
observations.
She was born on the 10th of
Sept. 1831 and is consequently
in her 37th year. For a long
time she attended our Sunday
school in Fulneck where
the seed of the Gospel was
sown in her heart. She liked
to thinks of those days.
In after times she became
a member of the congregation,


and took a delight in
the hallowed exercises of the
Sanctuary.
In 1853 she went to live
in the Sister's House, where
she continued until 1856;
once in that year she
received a call to Jamaica,
where according to the grace
given to her, she served
with her husband in five
congregations, in various parts
of the island.
By her quiet, unassuming
behaviour, and taking a
lively interest in any thing
relating to the people, she


gained their respect and affection
way awilited the esteem of our
fellow missionaries.
She was an affectionate and
devoted wife to her husband,
a loving and tender mother,
ever endeavoring to lead her
children unto Him who has said,
"Suffer little Children to come unto me."
Of a somewhat delicate
constitution, she was frequently
ailing and many a time has
been laid down with bilious
fever so common in the West
Indies. A year ago we
obtained permission to return to
England, especially with a view


of recruiting her health, but an
allwise Providence has seen fit
to ordain otherwise.
The day previous to her departure,
she had each of her Children brought
to her bedsnde, and most tenderly
embraced them, commanding them
to the Lord. She then
called for each one present, and
had on affectionate "farewell,"
saying a few appropriate words
to each. She then began to 
repeat the lines
"Jesus makes my heart rejoice, &c." 
She breathed her last while the old
test. benediction was being pronounced.
With kind love, You aff. brother,
James Ward
