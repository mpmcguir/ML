					<l>come and see her when she was a Corps, and spoke</l>
					<l>often with her father and Mother how they Should dress</l>
					<l>her when she was a corps, and what she would</l>
					<l>have in the coffin with her, but her greatest care</l>
					<l>was about the watch word which was on her Birthday</l>

					<l>which Continualy increased, and altho' she took</l>
					<l>medcin, yet neither that nor any thing els would</l>
					<l>rest upon her Stomoc. So that it was plain that our dear</l>
					<l>Saviour intended to take her into his Eternal Security</l>
					<l>when She was askd at any time what she wanted she</l>
					<l>always answred, I want our Saviour to come, when askd</l>

					<l>So that we though She would Soon go home, but on the Monday</l>
					<l>the doctor aplied something which gave her a little ease</l>
					<l>till Friday night, when her convulitions Returnd again</l>
					<l>So that one Expected her going home every houre, but She</l>

					<l>Strength of my heart, and my position for ever.</l>
