							<l><hi rend="underline">The Life of the S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Cennick who went happily home Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> 1770</hi></l>
							<l>I was born June the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> old Style 1712 in Reading Berks. </l>
							<l>wass baptiz&apos;d in the Church of England and brought up in that Comunion.</l>
							<l>The first thing I remember is the simple and happy intercourse I </l>
							<l>lived in with the Lord: I knew he lov&apos;d me; and I lov &apos;d him; &amp; therefore</l>
							<l>used to have recourse to Him without the least reserve.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>When I was about 5 Years old, I remember to have been particularly</l>
						<l>naughty &amp; selfwilld, which caused me much heaviness, tho&apos; I strove all</l>
						<l>I could to divert and get rid of the Conviction by play &amp;c. But</l>
						<l>running hastily into my Mothers room, where she was sitting with</l>
						<l>my late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John - then an Infant - lying in her lap.</l>
						<l>I saw her weeping with lifted up hands, and heard her pray. I was</l>
						<l>much affected: But felt so hard, to acknowledge my fault, but</l>
						<l>upon repeatedly asking my Mother, why she cried and what she</l>
						<l>was saying? She referr&apos;d the Cause to me and Said: &quot;I was praying</l>
						<l>for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> and for your Brother.&quot; This pierc&apos;d me through, and I</l>
						<l>thought my heart would break. For I thought, The Lord also is</l>
						<l>greived! I therefore silently withdrew condemn&apos;d and asham&apos;d</l>
						<l>and hasted to a private Place, where with many Tears, I beged</l>
						<l>Him to forgive me; which he most graciously did directly, and</l>
						<l>all my Burthen instantly removed.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>My Father and his Relations being all Quakers of the</l>
						<l>most primitive sort, and my Mother and hers all strict Church</l>
						<l>of England; Her attachment to, and chief acquaintance were the</l>
						<l>Clergy; So that I had the Oppertunity of an intimate familiarity</l>
						<l>with <add place="above">each</add>, not perceiving, at this time, the least disunion on either Side.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>Our Parish Vicar and his Family was a part of our</l>
						<l>most intimate acquaintance, and his Daughter, who had taken</l>
						<l>a liking to me from my Infancy, calling me her own Child,</l>
						<l>at last prevailed with my Parents, to take me more particularly</l>
						<l>home to her; But our houses Joining each other, I was nearly</l>
						<l>as much with my Parents as I was with them. This lady,</l>
						<l>taking me, to a friends house with her, I slip&apos;d out from</l>
						<l>the Company, and saw two small Boats fastened to the</l>
						<l>Landing Place in a deep Moat, I got into one of them</l>
						<l>and reached out of it to the Side of the other Boat:</l>
						<l>when both parting, and swiming from each other</l>
						<l>had dragged me out of that I stood in, had not the toes</l>
						<l>of my shoes hitch&apos;d in something, and prevented it:</l>
						<l>Thus hanging over the Water between both, I had</l>
						<l>scarce time to give my self up for lost, Before I Slip&apos;d</l>
						<l>my hold and pitched into the Water, where to my Joyfull</l>
						<l>surprise, instead of Sinking I found, as it were, Hands</l>

						<lg>
							<l>bearing so strong against my hands as to get and keep my head above</l>
							<l>water. Yea those kind Assistants bore me up so long, even till I was</l>
							<l>capable of taking hold with one Hand of that Boat, wherein, all </l>
							<l>while my shoes had hitch&apos;d, but how I recover&apos;d wholly, I never</l>
							<l>could remember, only that, as I came to my self, I was flat on</l>
							<l>my Back, safe and well. I know, who those ministers were, of</l>
							<l>whose kinder Orders they Obey&apos;d obeyed, and thanked them, and Him,</l>
							<l>Friend: beging Him 100 times over: O pray don&apos;t let it be found</l>
							<l>out &amp;c. Which, however remarkable, never was.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>I was this Gentlemans* <add place="margin">The parish vicar</add> fond Companion also, and often<note>In the memoir, the phrase "the parish vicar" is written in pencil
							in a different hand</note></l>
						<l>Slid unobserv&apos;d to him, when he was retir&apos;d to private Devotion</l>
						<l>sometimes I kneel&apos;d behind, and at other times close by his side,</l>
						<l>that I might be a partaker of those influences, which I beleiv&apos;d,</l>
						<l>he enjoy&apos;d.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>As I Grew older, I had more liberty among the Servants,</l>
						<l>who endeavour&apos;d to seduce me and bring me into all manner of</l>
						<l>Wickedness, as much as they could, But finding me frighten&apos;d,</l>
						<l>and fearing I should tell, they threaten&apos;d me hard, what they</l>
						<l>would do to me, if I did. This brought me more particularly to my</l>
						<l>own Hearts Friend, and they let me alone for sometime; till one</l>
						<l>evening, I went into a back Garden, where a Company of them wo</l>
						<l>got, but I did not know nor think of them, till I was almost</l>
						<l>shock&apos;d to death, and could scarce stagger into <add place="above">the House</add>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">door</hi>, when, even in</l>
						<l>the very Passage, the Lord met me, Comforted me, and gave me</l>
						<l>the Assurance in my Heart, &quot;He would preserve me for himself</l>
						<l>for ever.&quot; This Promise has always been a secret Comfort to me,</l>
						<l>all my Course through, yea even, when in the highest of my Folly</l>
						<l>in the World. I was near 8 years old, &amp; made a memorandum of that</l>
						<l>important Day. I was kept more close to my learning, and was</l>
						<l>instructed in all the Principles of the Church. I also got Courage</l>
						<l>to discover those notorious deceivers, without their knowing it was me</l>
						<l>Yet my Heart departed from its dearest Object, and I became as</l>
						<l>Formal and vain as any Body; I saw myself a fair Candidate</l>
						<l>for the World; but also, Ruin, Destruction, and eternal death</l>
						<l>stood as fair before me. This made me go on heavily, but I could</l>
						<l>tell no one: And as I was under Preparation for the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></l>
						<l>I was the more distress&apos;d; Sometimes in dispair and sometimes</l>
						<l>desperate. In this Situation I went to Evening Prayers, but I</l>
						<l>could neither pray, nor desire. I was so condemn&apos;d; But in the</l>
						<l>Begining of the last Prayers, my Heart became as melting Wax,</l>
						<l>and as such a Wretch I turn&apos;d again to my Friend, and begg&apos;d for mercy </l>
						<l>and got Confidence to trust and rely on him. I had sometime before</l>
						<l>privately made it out in my own mind, that, as Oppertunity should</l>
						<l>serve, I would privately retire to a Cloister, and in that especiall</l>
						<l>manner dedicate myself to the Lord Forever.</l>

							<l>In my 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year it was thought proper by my Friends, that I should</l>
							<l>go to London for further Improvement. I was receiv&apos;d with the</l>
							<l>greatest heartiness, and every one was kindly officious in bringing </l>
							<l>me to public Places, and shewing me the Curiosities of the Town. I</l>
							<l>saw the Glory&apos;s of the World - and loved it - and concluded, as I had</l>
							<l>often been told, I was made for the World, for it suited my Inclination</l>
							<l>and tast every way; And I had well nigh set through all Convictions,</l>
							<l>Though at the Bottom I had a Condemn&apos;d heart and guilty Conscience.</l>
							<l>My Mother being in London at this time took me with her, to see a</l>
							<l>Friend of hers in Bedlam, and surveying the many Shocking objects</l>
							<l>there, she tumed to me and said. &quot;This is the <add place="above">sad</add> effect of Love and Pride.&quot;</l>
							<l>I made her no answere; but ispairingly despairingly thought: and this will</l>
							<l>one day be my unhappy Case unless God exert his Almighty</l>
							<l>Power in rescuing me. </l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>I soon followed my Mother privately to Reading, giving all my</l>
						<l>Acquaintance the Slip; But was soon surrounded with my old</l>
						<l>Friends and Acquaintance who were very desireous to hear news, and</l>
						<l>learn more particularly the Fashions of the Town. I told them, I was</l>
						<l>quite tired of all those things, and therefore resolv&apos;d soon to retire from</l>
						<l>all, and come and live in a quite different way: If any of them 
							w<hi rend="strikethrough">h</hi>ere </l>
						<l>inclin&apos;d to make one of the Company, when I came to settle at home,</l>
						<l>it could be made out.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>From this time I had no rest for my poor distresst Heart &amp; mind</l>
						<l>Therefore in my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year I left London the Last time, to put in practice</l>
						<l>what I had so long purposed, renewing my Acquaintance with the</l>
						<l>most solid and religious Part of my Friends. I followed as near</l>
						<l>as I could. Step for step, with my Mother &amp; Brother, who had</l>
						<l>begun some time ago a more religious Course of Life; But, alas!</l>
						<l>I grew faint hearted and 
							tir&apos;d: And seeing all my Works, Prayers</l>
						<l>and Duties, good for nothing at all, and I myself that same de-</l>
						<l>plorable Creature as ever I was, I 
							cry&apos;d out in the Bitterness of</l>
						<l>my Soul: O Lord Jesus Christ&apos; if this is the way to Heaven, I shall</l>
						<l>never come there! My distress still increased, being more &amp; more</l>
						<l>Sensible of my Degeneracy; But above all did my base ingratitude</l>
						<l>to my once so tender Lover fill me with horror and Dejection. </l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>We had heard of the Awakening in Oxford, where my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> went,</l>
						<l>got acquainted with several, and brought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Kinchin<hi rend="strikethrough">g</hi> to our house;</l>
						<l>and afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesleys, Hutchins, Whitfield &amp;c. I was much</l>
						<l>
							perplex&apos;d in my own mind at this rash (as I thought then) proceeding</l>
						<l>of my Brothers, fearing a Schism in the Church. But being convinced</l>
						<l>of the truth of their Doctrine, was soon Zealously attached thereto.</l>
						<l>But the Preaching being in our House, it made a great stir in the</l>
						<l>Town, and caused us much Trouble and disgrace; So that my Mother</l>
						<l>hearing of it in London, came home, and put an intire Stop to it.</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Hereupon my Brother went to Bristoll, and I, and a well disposed singled</l>
							<l>Woman took a house in the Town; but the Preaching was given up.</l>
							<l>By these means got the ill Will of all my Friends and Relations</l>
							<l>My Acquaintance also shun&apos;d me, and every one&apos;s Face was set against</l>
							<l>me. Thus forsaken of all, and destitute of my best Friend, I grew</l>
							<l>dejected, and quite malancholy.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>In 1740 I visited Kingswood and Bristol; but could not be reconcil&apos;d</l>
						<l>to those Agitations among the Methodists at that time. Here I had</l>
						<l>happiness of seeing first our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Toellshig, who seeing my concern,</l>
						<l>help&apos;d me much. I soon return&apos;d to Reading exceedingly distress&apos;d,</l>
						<l>And finding my dear Companion so happy in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and myself</l>
						<l>so wretched, I gave up all hopes of ever being sav&apos;d. But here in</l>
						<l>one moment did my most gracious Saviour reveal Himself to me,</l>
						<l>forgave me all my sin, and in an instant I was dispossess&apos;d of every</l>
						<l>Pain: I could hardly tell if I was in the Body or not. For my heart</l>
						<l>saw nothing but Jesus. I felt after Sin; but behold! there was</l>
						<l>no Sin. I felt after my own guilt and Distress, but there was</l>
						<l>no Place found for them, and nothing but light surrounded me. </l>
						<l>I had not enjoy&apos;d this happiness long, before my venerable Companion</l>
						<l>fell happily asleep on the Bosom of her eternal Bridegroom.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>At my return the former Disturbances were reviv&apos;d. many were</l>
						<l>distresst concerning their Salvation; And the Clergy being greatly</l>
						<l>perplex&apos;d, endeavour&apos;d to put me to Trouble; But our Saviour</l>
						<l>kept me stay&apos;d upon Him and deliver&apos;d me safe out of their Hands.</l>
						<l>I gave up my House, and went again to Kingswood, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
						<l>Whitfield, my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and others were separated from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesleys, and</l>
						<l>had begun more regular Society, and gave me the care of the</l>
						<l>Single Women, with whom I labour'd as well as I could;</l>
						<l>But knowing my own Insufficiency, and seeing many Irregularities</l>
						<l>creeping in among the Young People, I told my Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> this was not</l>
						<l>what suited me; and therefore I came to Reading, where a Widow</l>
						<l>Quaker Gentlewoman had long and often desir&apos;d I would stay with</l>
						<l>her and <hi rend="underline">take</hi>
							<add place="above">use</add> her House as my own. I did so, And all my Quaker</l>
						<l>Friends were exceeding kind to me, and earnestly wish&apos;d me to</l>
						<l>settle amongst them; I would have done it, but had no leave from</l>
						<l>our Savr in my own Heart. My Mind was secretly Hankering</l>
						<l>after a Cloister: But my Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> desiring my Assistance at</l>
						<l>Tetherton, I went to him, and with all the Money I had, Goods &amp;</l>
						<l>Furniture, engaged with him, and the Peace of God ruled &amp; rested</l>
						<l>upon us.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>In 44 I went on a Visit to London, where our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stonehouse</l>
						<l>brought me aquainted with my ever dearest Anna Johanna, with</l>
						<l>whom my Heart was tenderly united, as was hers to me.</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>I had heard of the Order among the Single Sisters, and that it was</l>
							<l>something like a Nunery, which exacted my enquiry and I wish&apos;d once</l>
							<l>to see such a Choir. My Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had already contracted a large Acquaintance</l>
							<l>with the Brethren, and sometime after gave our Societies into their</l>
							<l>care and went on a Visit to Hhaag, and from thence to Ireland.</l>
							<l>In his Absence I had the favour of a Visit at Tetherton from our late</l>
							<l>d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple and Discipless, Christel, Anna Johanna &amp;c. The Discipless</l>
							<l>was particularly hearty with me to, whom, at first, I was somewhat</l>
							<l>reserved; But coming upon Heart Matters, I was quite openhearted,</l>
							<l>and she spoke to me in the most Comfortable and encouraging manner,</l>
							<l>telling me, how tenderly She and her Company felt towards me, and</l>
							<l>assuring me of our Saviours Thoughts of Peace concerning me.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>My Brother soon after return&apos;d, who told me yet more about the</l>
						<l>single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, and how earnestly he had Pray&apos;d our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to bring me </l>
						<l>into their happy Circle, That he knew it was just a Regulation as</l>
						<l>would please me. Upon duly weighing the matter before our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I wrote</l>
						<l>to my much respected Friend, the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Discipless for leave to visit the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></l>
						<l>in Germany, who readily granted me the favour. My Mother also</l>
						<l>at this time, was well inclin&apos;d towards to Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; But meeting with</l>
						<l>some unhpy Circumstances, she was turn&apos;d quite against them: And</l>
						<l>tho&apos; I was much Staggered, yet our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> preserved me, and gave me Courage</l>
						<l>of persevere in my Purpose. Yet I had it hard to get away, and was forc&apos;d</l>
						<l>to leave her against her Will.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>In March 1747 I arrived with many more English Brethen and</l>
						<l>Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> together with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; Sis Teltschig in Hhaag, where I m<hi rend="strikethrough">e</hi>et with</l>
						<l>the most cordial reception from our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple &amp; Discipless.</l>
						<l>The Congregation and its regulations I saw with wonder and delight;</l>
						<l>Especially that of the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. My first Intention only was to Visit</l>
						<l>the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, and not to become a Member thereof; But in London, on my</l>
						<l>way h<hi rend="strikethrough">e</hi>ither, being a Spectator at the Holy Communion, I was so affected</l>
						<l>that I forgott my Resolution; Till by Occasion, soon after my arrival,</l>
						<l>I grew Suspicious, till I was quite confus&apos;d. But having an unreserved</l>
						<l>Confidence to the late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Discipless, I told her all my Concern, who</l>
						<l>with the greatest tenderness &amp; Frankness clear&apos;d up those matters which</l>
						<l>had given me so much pain. I now became quite happy and saw</l>
						<l>the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in a right light, and the Beginning of that happy Period,</l>
						<l>which the H Ghost had so many years been preparing me for.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>I had the Grace to be received into the Congregation the same year,</l>
						<l>Was soon after Confirm&apos;d and in Jan 1748 was made a happy Partaker</l>
						<l>of the Lords Body and Blood in the H Communion. Here also I</l>
						<l>had the Grace to be admitted into the Class of Intercessors, and soon</l>
						<l>after set out with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boehler &amp;c. for England. Our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Papa,</l>
						<l>Mamma, the Mother, Anna Johanna &amp;c. accompanied us to Francfort,</l>

						<l>After staying sometime in London, I was sent to Fulneck, where</l>
						<l>I was one of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Servants, Choir Servant &amp; Helper. In June</l>
						<l>1750 I was called to London, where I enjoy&apos;d many blessings in the</l>
						<l>Dear Disciples House in Bloomsbury Square. From whence I</l>
						<l>was sent to Dublin to have the Care of the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> There and in the</l>
						<l>north of Ireland. The same year I visited the North, and the Year</l>
						<l>after was sent there; where also, as in Dublin our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> accom-</l>
						<l>panied, blessed and prosper&apos;d me, gave me the Hearts of the Sisters,</l>
						<l>for whom I have ever retained the tenderest affection, and shall</l>
						<l>to my latest Breath. So that, notwithstanding the many heavy</l>
						<l>Circumstances, I enjoy&apos;d the still Communion with my Hearts</l>
						<l>best Friend; Nor were my many Faults, weaknesses and mistakes</l>
						<l>a hindrence thereto. </l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>In Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1758 I got a Call to the Disciple House, from my</l>
						<l>dear Anna Johanna. And the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> arriv&apos;d S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ripley </l>
						<l>and Matty Haley, who were most heartily receiv&apos;d by all, and</l>
						<l>especially by our own d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> little Choir in Ballunderry. </l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>The 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Spoke the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to the Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and in the
							Afternoon</l>
						<l>we partook of the same. Particular meetings were appointed</l>
						<l>in all the Plans for the Reception of the above two Sisters, which</l>
						<l>with other meetings and matters lasted to the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> when we</l>
						<l>viz: B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Watson, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Mary, Marg<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Graham a Widow, myself,</l>
						<l>My dear little Neice Betsey Cennick, and Betsey Mortimer,</l>
						<l>set off from Ballunderry, and came to Bellfast the same evening</l>
						<l>where we were detain&apos;d till the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> when in our way down</l>
						<l>to the Vessel S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary got a sad fall; we got on board however</l>
						<l>the same evening. On the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a Voilent Storm arose and</l>
						<l>we were given up for lost. this was a trying Circumstance</l>
						<l>to me, after I had gone through so many trials before; But</l>
						<l>I immediately turn&apos;d to my best and <add place="above">only</add> Friend, thought perhaps</l>
						<l>I was the Jonas and therefore became a sinner before Him on all</l>
						<l>accounts, and in 5 minutes all were well between Him and</l>
						<l>me, and my heart rejoice&apos;d that I should so soon see him. the WW<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></l>
						<l>of the Day was. Rom. 14, 8. &quot;Wether we live, we live unto the Lord,</l>
						<l>or wether we die, we die unto the Lord.&quot;</l>
						<l>&quot;Must a ling&apos;ring Death await us, This Text ever will stand Good:</l>
						<l>He in Glory to translate us, Purchas&apos;d all Things by his Blood.&quot;</l>
						<l>The 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> we got among the sandbanks. The 29 we landed in </l>
						<l>Liver Pool safe and well. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> we came to Fulneck abt</l>

							<l>And in the evening S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary sent to invite me into her house, where</l>
							<l>I enjoy &apos;d many Blessings; till in Jan. 59 B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Houptmann</l>
							<l>received their Call to Bedford, I embrace&apos;d this Oppertunity of going</l>
							<l>with them from hence to that Place, where I was receiv&apos;d with the</l>
							<l>greatest love and heartiness. I soon went to London, when, after</l>
							<l>waiting along while, and meeting with many hindrences, however</l>
							<l>on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May I arrived with several more Brethern &amp; Sisters</l>
							<l>to my exceeding great Joy, having that long wish&apos;d for happiness</l>
							<l>of seeing my dear Papa, Mamagen and Anna Johanna once more.</l>
							<l>The 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I was brought to Annenhoff, where I enjoy&apos;d many inexpressible</l>
							<l>Blessings. The 1<hi rend="superscript">4th</hi> I was receiv&apos;d as Acoluth and ordained a Deaconess. </l>
							<l>Here I had the favour of Staying till the Close thereof, a time,</l>
							<l>I shall never forget. July the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I set out from Zeist with the</l>
							<l>respectable B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H<add place="above">ei</add>nrichs von Reuss &amp; Salome Gross came to</l>
							<l>Gnadenthal August the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to Kleinwelke, &amp; the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to Hhuth,</l>
							<l>where I enjoy&apos;d a real Sabatic season, Continuing in the most</l>
							<l>tender Comunion with my eternal Friends; and in heartiest</l>
							<l>Fellowship with all. At the latter end of this year our dear</l>
							<l>Disciple House arrived to the universal great joy of all here; I</l>
							<l>had the Blessing of being present at the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Synod to the end;</l>
							<l>as also at that memorable Conclusion of the faithfull Labour of those</l>
							<l>two eminent Witnesses the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple &amp; Disciples of Jesus in May 1760.</l>
							<l>That Peace of God, which came more espeically upon the</l>
							<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> at that time, I also partook of in a particular manner</l>
							<l>In which happy Sensation I left Hhuth Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi

							</l>
							<l>Teltschig and came to Kleinwelke; the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to Barby; there I</l>
							<l>enjoy&apos;d many particular Blessings. The 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> we proceeded</l>
							<l>on our Journey, and came to Zeist on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. From thence we</l>
							<l>came to London Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, And the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I came to Bedford, where</l>
							<l>I was receiv&apos;d most heartily and it went blessed<add place="above">ly</add> for a time, but</l>
							<l>afterwards not so; Therefore I was sent to Lembster to</l>
							<l>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rice to have the Care of some young Women, Collected</l>
							<l>from several Parts, there being only two Natives. As to outward</l>
							<l>Circumstances it was morally impossible to come thro&apos; in a manner</l>
							<l>suitable to an Oeconomy; But the principle thing in the whole</l>
							<l>was <add place="above">the</add> want of hearts, and the true Spirit of Love and Harmony</l>
							<l>amongs&apos;t us all. I shall not enter into Farther Particulars,</l>

							<l>Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Vogls<hi rend="superscript">ng</hi> in Caring for the S. Sisters and Great Girls of</l>
							<l>the Country Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>. I receiv&apos;d my Call with awe &amp; real bow-</l>
							<l>edness of heart. I wrote to S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary on that account, who answer&apos;d</l>
							<l>me as a Priestess of God. In Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I set out with a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. and his</l>
							<l>Daughter a great Girl, who had lived with me, for ockbrook,</l>
							<l>where she was to reside. We arrived there safe and well after</l>
							<l>a heavy Journey, and I stay&apos;d to refresh myself for several days</l>
							<l>among my old Acquaintance and then set out for Fulneck.</l>
							<l>On the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I came to Leeds where our late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shultze was</l>
							<l>waiting to bring me to Fulneck the next Day, and presented me</l>
							<l>with a very hearty Congratulatory Letter from my D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary</l>
							<l>We arrived at Fulneck ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Noon on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> and met with a</l>
							<l>very hearty Reception from all my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> old S. Sisters, and stay&apos;d</l>
							<l>till the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Jan; when I was brought to Gumersall Oeconomy be</l>
							<l>S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary and Ann Birkby. I felt well as soon as I enterd the</l>
							<l>House. Early the next morning the <add place="above">two</add> above mentioned Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></l>
							<l>took their leave of us. I got alone into my little room and</l>
							<l>kept a hearty Band with my Best Friend, and with many </l>
							<l>tears devoted myself afresh to him: Put Him in mind of his</l>
							<l>Promise viz: That He would once bring me into an</l>
							<l>Asylum, where I should enjoy a real Sabatic sea-</l>
							<l>son and Bridal Intercourse with Him, preparatory</l>
							<l>to his taking me into His arms and Bosom.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>He shewed me something more concerning my present call, than I</l>
						<l>found, Some others knew, and was to remain a sceeret between Him</l>
						<l>and me, I soon found myself at Home, and that he would bring</l>
						<l>me safely thro&apos;. I felt also that the Hearts of the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were tenderly</l>
						<l>inclin&apos;d towards me; so that we soon became one Heart and one</l>
						<l>Mind, and a Blessed Period commence&apos;d, tho&apos; under many Difficulties.</l>
						<l>Not long after, a certain Sabbatic mood and most intimat inter-</l>
						<l>course, between me and my Friend took Place; So that my</l>
						<l>Labour among the Souls, was my Delight, it per adventure</l>
						<l>I might happily gain some, to become lovers of this my so favourite</l>
						<l>Object. My Journeys were long and heavy, to go to the different</l>
						<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>, and I being very weakly made me oft secretly sigh and weep be</l>
						<l>fore my Friend: For it being just the depth of the winter that I come here,</l>
						<l>made walking in those bad roads almost impracticable; But here I must</l>
						<l>mention with the greatest gratitude &amp; humility the more then</l>
						<l>Brotherly &amp; Sisterly love and Faithfullness of my good, old,</l>
						<l>venerable Hearts Watsons; Happy for me they were at this time</l>

							<l>living here in Gumersall, and had the Care of Wyke Plan also, they</l>
							<l>therefore most Chearfully help&apos;d me always, when, and where they</l>

						<l>For this Year last past, I have felt that my time was out</l>
						<l>in Gummersal, and last summer thought I should get a Call after</l>
						<l>the Synod; but could never find out any Place where I could be sent</l>
						<l>to. I once kept a hearty Band with my Friend about it, at the</l>
						<l>Conclusion of which, and summing up the whole, I said to Him:</l>
						<l>&quot;Now would it not be better thou tookst me home to thy <add place="above">own dr</add> self.&quot;</l>
						<l>I had no room to suspect any thing of the kind, from what I felt from him</l>
						<l>at that time; But July last, As I was in the Chaple <add place="above">Garden</add> at Work, He drew near</l>
						<l>To me in an extraordinary manner, and discover&apos;d to me Such an Union</l>
						<l>&amp; oneness between Him &amp; me, as is altogether unutterable, tho&apos; I </l>
						<l>did attempt to express something of it in a few Verses.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>From this time I had often gentle hints of a Change, of something that would</l>
						<l>take place, which should entirely suit me.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>In August last I got it Voilent Cold, which grew worse &amp; worse,</l>
						<l>And found my Lungs were infected. In the Beginning of Sept last,</l>
						<l>I felt myself strangly ill; so as I had never been before, which lasted</l>
						<l>some few nights &amp; days; And during the whole time, I was most happily</l>
						<l>Comforted with my Friends nearness, Insomuch that I felt no illness at all,</l>
						<l>only that I was weak and drowsy. One night, unasked for, He</l>
						<l>came Close to my Bedside, and stood there. My Heart saw Him,</l>
						<l>And my Soul adored Him! He dispersed intirely in a moment</l>
						<l>every painfull thought and Sensation, inwardly and outwardly</l>
						<l>I felt after one Wound and another sore; But behold! they were all</l>
						<l>healed. I felt after Sin, and there was no sin. I felt after misery</l>
						<l>and Dejection, But there was none to be found; And thus I was made</l>
						<l>sound and whole, except those pleasing Wounds of Love, which He</l>
						<l>had made long before in my enamour&apos;d Heart, But now more</l>
						<l>Deeply impress&apos;d.</l>
					</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>Now it was, He gave me, the soft impression of his Gracious</l>
						<l>intention Concerning me; while I silently worship&apos;d before Him.</l>
						<l>On the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lorel called on us in her return from</l>
						<l>Duckenfield, and was quite alarm&apos;d at my seeming bad state</l>
						<l>of Health, would not rest, But insisted on my going to Fulneck,</l>

							<l>seemingly, fix&apos;d and suited; But my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lorel could not be reconcil&apos;d</l>

							<l>Faithfulness and Affection: In these Circumstances she could not be</l>
							<l>prevailed upon to be Satisfy&apos;d, unless I came to Fulneck.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
						<l>I therefore set out in mere faith, with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Fowler and</l>

							<add place="margin">1769</add> and arriv&apos;d here safe, and meet with a very</l>
						<l>hearty Reception. The first d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heart which saluted me, was</l>
						<l>my most dear and venerable Heart Anna Johanna; I was also made</l>
						<l>happily sensable of that genuine Love and hearty affection of the</l>
						<l>Choir in general, And more especially <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi>
							<add place="above">from</add> all those in Office; so that</l>
						<l>that peace of God, and that Sabbath, which I never had heard any</l>
						<l>one possessing, at least so long before their Departure, accompanied</l>
						<l>me here also in the clearest manner, which begun at the time above</l>
						<l>mentioned, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> manifested Himself to me in such an</l>
						<l>especiall manner. But here I must mention some essential</l>
						<l>things, which I forgot to mention in their proper places, viz.</l>
						<l>After all that the Lord had done for me, and I was clear and well</l>
						<l>establish&apos;d in it: One Day, as He &amp; I were solacing ourselves in</l>
						<l>each others love, it came into my mind; But that oneness &amp; union</l>
						<l>which I had possessed in Him. I was not so clear in at this time: He</l>
						<l>shew&apos;d me, I was wholly in Him and He in me, and that we</l>
						<l>were One as he and the Father are One. I saw myself cloathed</l>
						<l>upon in Him, and possessed of all the Bridal Ornaments of the Bridegroom. </l>
						<l>I must therefore ascribe all the Honour and Glory alone to my own d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</l>
						<l>eternal Slaughter&apos;d Lord and Saviour and conclude my</l>
						<l>Narrative with the Greatest truth in all the World: viz.</l>
						<l>That, Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded</l>
						<l>Much more.</l>

						<l>Our venerable and Happily departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Cennick,</l>

							<l>Her Soul magnify&apos;d the Lord, and her Spirit daily rejoiced in God</l>

							<l>energy, as is not to be expresst in words, which bears an Indelible</l>
