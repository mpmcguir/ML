							<l>to her Husband, She went on in a still course,</l>
							<l>and was of a few words, and loved our </l>

							<l>room with chearfulness to the Married choir,</l>
							<l>particularly on Sundays, for them to sit</l>
							<l>and keep their Bands, she was of a very </l>
							<l><del>Healthy</del> Healthy constitution, and did not</l>
							<l>know what sickness was, till within half</l>
							<l>a year past, when her strength began to</l>
							<l>fail, &amp; felt much pain in her Tabernacle </l>
							<l>She then said and believed that this would</l>
							<l>prove the means of her Dissolution, to which </l>
							<l>she was Resign&apos;d &amp; said that she might go</l>
							<l>Home to her dear Saviour, she was however</l>
							<l>willing to use any means which were</l>
							<l>recommended, to her, but all was without</l>
							<l>Effect, at last she was obliged to take to </l>
							<l>her Bed, which she has kept above 3 months</l>
							<l>and endured often much pain, having</l>
							<l>lost the use of most of her Limbs, her</l>
							<l>prayer to our Saviour was Constantly</l>
							<l>that He might give her patience to hold</l>
							<l>out till he Should think fit to release her,</l>
							<l>which was in a particular manner granted</l>
							<l>to her, for she bore every thing very patiently</l>

							<l>her End, a few minutes before her depart</l>
							<l>ure she said: Lord Jesus help me,</l>
							<l>a Liturgy was kept her, during which</l>

							<l>felt, she then received the Blessing of her</l>
							<l>Husband and Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and fell quite</l>
