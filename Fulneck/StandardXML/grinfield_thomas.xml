							<l><hi rend="underline">Memoir of the late Rev. Thos. Grinfield</hi></l>
							<l>The very thought of writing any thing like</l>
							<l>a memoir of myself the poorest among the </l>
							<l>Lords poor ones has produced a thrilling sens-</l>
							<l>sation, so that after its composition, I have more</l>
							<l>than once consigned it to the fire. But as my</l>
							<l>high Calling of God in Christ Jesus, &amp; the events </l>
							<l>previous to my fellowship with the Bre</l>
							<l>threns Church and strikingly marked with</l>
							<l>the divine finger, I durst not refuse to re-</l>
							<l>cord to the Glory of God a brief narration of</l>
							<l>the special circumstances that princi-</l>
							<l>pally bear on these two points.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>It pleased God that I should draw my first</l>
							<l>breath in the house of my parents at Salis-</l>
							<l>bury Apr 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. 1748. Much as I wish to ho-</l>
							<l>nour the memory of my dear father &amp; mother,</l>

							<l>they canot be considered in any other</l>
							<l>view than as refined deists. Moral as was</l>
							<l>their character before men; they were immi-</l>
							<l>cal to divine Revelation &amp; its doctrines; </l>
							<l>&amp; as a consequence at times showed their</l>
							<l>aversion to all in every demonination</l>

							<l>of the Gospel. The question may now</l>
							<l>be asked, how could the children of parents</l>
							<l>thus disposed expect to be brought up in</l>
							<l>the fear &amp; nurture of the Lord? Much as they</l>
							<l>might wish to instil morality on their</l>
							<l>sinful minds, their general education</l>
							<l>would have been according to the Philoso-</l>
							<l>phical axioms so prevalent at that period.</l>
							<l>I was the youngest of three brothers; the</l>
							<l>eldest went early to Winchester school, be-</l>
							<l>ing designed for the Bar. The second to</l>
							<l>Westminister for the army. From seven</l>
							<l>years old, I was a day scholar at the Ca-</l>
							<l>thedral Grammar school, &amp; had my</l>
							<l>father lived till I had reached twelve years</l>
							<l>was to go to Winchester College.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>I must now revert to the awful</l>
							<l>events which under Providence led to the</l>
							<l>opening of the Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> gracious purposes</l>
							<l>with me. In 1759 it pleased God to re-</l>
							<l>move both my honoured parents with-</l>
							<l>in 9 weeks of each other, my mother of</l>
							<l>a consumption in July; my father in</l>
							<l>Octr of a gouty spasm on the heart</l>
							<l>while conversing with me after dinner</l>
							<l>on my going to Winchester next Easter</l>

							<l>such awful bereavements are frequently </l>
							<l>Mendid with incalcuable loss to minors,</l>
							<l>but my all merciful God, caused them in</l>
							<l>the signal to work for my educational gain.</l>
							<l>For <hi rend="underline">He who knows the end from the begin-</hi></l>
							<l><hi rend="underline">ning</hi> saw me (a poor orphan) <hi rend="underline">lying on</hi></l>
							<l><hi rend="underline">my blood</hi>, (spiritual death) without any</l>
							<l>to pity my forlorn case. Thank God, I am</l>
							<l>now in my 76<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, &amp; enabled to believe</l>
							<l>that my time of love was come. This</l>
							<l>thoughts of peace concerning me were gra-</l>
							<l>dually to be fulfilled, that my lost &amp;</l>
							<l>dead soul should live by faith to Him on</l>
							<l>her earth &amp; when his good work in me</l>
							<l>should be finished, live with Christ in</l>
							<l>his glorious kingdom. O most unwor-</l>
							<l>they am I of these ever blessed prospects.</l>
							<l>Since the call of an immortal soul from</l>
							<l>death to life &amp; from darkness to light in</l>
							<l>the most important by all events, no</l>
							<l>incident combined with its spiritual</l>
							<l>progress, trivial as it may appear to</l>
							<l>carnal wisdom will be deemed so by</l>
							<l>by him, who has ears to hear &amp; eyes to</l>
							<l>see, with a heart to understand the mys-</l>

							<l>In my father&apos;s will to guardians were</l>
							<l>appointed, his only brother &amp; one of my mo-</l>
							<l>ther&apos;s Brothers. The first immediately</l>
							<l>entered on the change. The whole landed</l>
							<l>property was left to our eldest brother</l>
							<l>with small fortunes to the younger chil-</l>
							<l>dren. My uncle aware that mine was</l>
							<l>by no means sufficient to pursue my</l>
							<l>honoured father&apos;s intention for the Church</l>
							<l>determined to take me to one of the most</l>
							<l>respectabile schools at Bristol. His friends</l>
							<l>in this city mentioned the late Rev. W.</l>
							<l>Foote, who taught latin &amp; greek before</l>
							<l>in the mornings. After dinner Writing,</l>
							<l>Arithmetic, &amp; the rudiments of Geometry</l>
							<l>were taught by the Usher. Here I was</l>
							<l>entered about Michaelmas following.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>The leading reason of my being settled</l>
							<l>here instead of London, was that my ex-</l>
							<l>cellent &amp; truly pious Aunt Anne, resi-</l>
							<l>ded in Bristol &amp; was on the point of</l>
							<l>joining the Moravians. In this event </l>
							<l>the divine finger is most evident. In</l>
							<l>Eternity I shall have abundant cause</l>
							<l>to thank &amp; praise my faithful Shepherd</l>
							<l>for having brought me his poor straying</l>

							<l>The Sunday&apos;s and half yearly vacations were</l>
							<l>generally spent under her roof. My Aunt</l>
							<l>occasionally touched in a very delicate</l>
							<l>manner &amp; suited to my capacity on divine</l>
							<l>vine subjects, particularly of the histo-</l>
							<l>ries of Joseph &amp; Samuel. My ears were</l>
							<l>then quick to hear the words, new as</l>
							<l>they seemed, yet the dulness &amp; hardness</l>
							<l>of my heart prevented me from com-</l>
							<l>prehending their spiritual import.</l>

							<l>After many months she pressed me to</l>
							<l>accompany her to the Chapel. Unplea-</l>
							<l>sant reports of the Moravians had</l>
							<l>been instilled into my ears by the el-</l>
							<l>der boys of the school. These added to</l>
							<l>the natural enmity of my heart to</l>
							<l>serious subjects urged me to refuse</l>
							<l>to go anywhere except to the parish</l>
							<l>church. Near two years had elapsed</l>
							<l>before my Aunt, having some ladies</l>
							<l>belonging to the Brn, in her house, re-</l>
							<l>quested me to attend her now &amp; then to</l>

							<l>vailed over all antipathies. The sermon</l>

							<l>The evangelical style was so new to my</l>

							<l>regulations, that I scarcely understood the</l>
							<l>drift of the sermon, nor was I pleased with</l>
							<l>the mode of worship. My Guardian seri-</l>
							<l>ously thought of my learning the Italian</l>
							<l>method of Book keeping to prepare me</l>
							<l>for a merchants Comfiting house. In</l>
							<l>1762 he placed me with an excellent Mas-</l>
							<l>ter who was to devote 2 or 3 hours a day in</l>
							<l>hearing me read the Classics in which</l>
							<l>I had made good proficiency. This Gentle-</l>
							<l>man&apos;s academy was near the chapel I</l>
							<l>began to attend very frequently with the</l>
							<l>children of the principal members. In</l>
							<l>a few months I had leave the attend the Soci-</l>

							<l>ly caused of the inattention to the warn-</l>
							<l>ings of the Holy Spirit &amp; from a desire to </l>
							<l>rise in the world, deferring the salvation</l>
							<l>of his soul to a future period, ignorant</l>
							<l>how suddenly the thread of mortal life</l>
							<l>may be snapped by God in whose hand</l>
							<l>are the timer. His tears &amp; heartrendings</l>
							<l>accompanied with the deep sense of be-</l>
							<l>ing fovever lost, caused him to be hum-</l>
							<l>bled before God &amp; in real earnest to call </l>
							<l>upon the Saviour for the remission of</l>
							<l>all his sins &amp; follies in his all cleansing</l>
							<l>&amp; purifying blood. A short time before his </l>
							<l>departure, the good &amp; faithful Shepherd</l>
							<l>graciously assured him of an interest</l>
							<l>in the great mediatorial sacrifice. By</l>

							<l>&amp; fastening the door kneeled down by the</l>

							<l>time should come, I might be prepared</l>
							<l>to go in peace to my eternal home.</l>

							<l>Have I not just cause for considering</l>
							<l>this important event as my first</l>
