					<l>The Course of Life of Anna Rogers</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>I was born at Bedford on the 15 of August 1743 an lived</l>
					<l>with my Parrents till I was 7 years old, at that time I had</l>
					<l>not the least concern about our Saviour, but still I remember</l>
					<l>I was always afraid of dying, in the year 50 I and my</l>
					<l>two Sisters were taken into the Sisters House to live amongst</l>
					<l>the Children, I by my unbroken self wild disposion causd the</l>
					<l>Sisters a great deal of troube and Concern which I was very Sencable</l>
					<l>of and out of Pity to the Sisters us'd to make resolutions that I</l>
					<l>would alter for the better yet all that was to no purposse for I being</l>
					<l>naturerly of a Proud unsinnerlike and fretfull temper could bear</l>
					<l>to be found fault with all tho' I how I was to blame and often</l>
					<l>felt pain on account of it I told our Saviour what a poor creature</l>
					<l>I was and sometimes beg'd him with tears to come to my Assistance</l>
					<l>and to me feel his grace in my heart amidst all my untowardness</l>
					<l>I was fully convincd that our Saviour Persu'd me very closely tho' I strove</l>
					<l>to put him off and went on in a dry and indifferant manner, and by</l>
					<l>so doing tryd our Saviour Patientious exceeding but his love towards</l>
					<l>me his poor Child never ceasd; at certain time I was overcome in</l>
					<l>a power full manner perticularly in those Meetings which us Children</l>
					<l>kept amongst our Selves, as on our Singing hours were his perecious</l>
					<l>nearness was so captivating to my heart that I often burst out into</l>
					<l>a flood of tears on the 17 August 53 that never to be forgoten day</l>
					<l>Br Sclicht who was then at Bedford kept a Love feast with he</l>
					<l>asking us in a tender manner if we from this time on woud Surrender</l>
					<l>our selves to our Saviour and then he desired as to Prostrate before him</l>
					<l>this being the first Meeting of that kind I <del>was ever</del> ever was present as I was</l>
					<l>Sear'd with love and awe in such a manner that my heart melted into</l>
					<l>tears of the thro' bord feet of our friend and lover whos precious nearness</l>
					<l>left a deep impression upon my poor heart In 59 I went live in the</l>
					<l>Oeconomay at Chelsea where I had the grace and favour sometime to</l>
					<l>enjoy the Meeting, which the dear disciple kept when the Girls Oeconomy</l>

					<l>removed to fulneck I also went with them and woul lived very chearfully</l>
					<l>in the begining but my depravity begun to grow Stronger and Stronger and</l>
					<l>I lost that Childlike feeling which I had had of our Saviour and by degrees</l>
					<l>become more and more indifferent in my heart in 56 I was recived into</l>
					<l>the great girls Choir in which I did not spend my time to our Saviour nor</l>
					<l>my Sisters satisfaction and being convinsd of it I begun to be exceeding</l>
					<l>uneasy in my mind and wishd that I might once be made Sencable of</l>
					<l>the cause of my unhappyness and why I did not prosper but I did not</l>
					<l>not know my own heart neither our Saviours intention I was obligd to</l>
					<l>wait long before I was recived into the Congregation and therefore I was</l>
					<l>apt to think that I was forgoten by my B<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">rn</hi> and S<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">rs</hi> but I
						found</l>
					<l>afterwards that my heart at that time was not prepared for it and</l>
					<l>begun to discover so much of my own sinfulness I lost all hopes of</l>
					<l>being recived how ever our Saviour granted me this grace on the 21</l>
					<l>of August which proved a real blessing to me at that time I prayd</l>
					<l>our Sariour to grant me on abideing <del>ing</del> feeling of his nearness &amp;</l>
					<l>let me once expernce the forgiveness of all my Sins but I soon lost</l>
					<l>that desire again grew cold in my heart and gave up all hopes that I </l>
					<l>Shoud ever be other ways some time I usd to think in a reasoning way</l>
					<l>that our Saviour did not hear my Prayers Since my good resolutions</l>
					<l>were all to no purpose this reflection made me grow quite negleject</l>
					<l>about my Self and evrything else Ive folo'd to be no more concern'd it</l>
					<l>might go as it woud in this uphappy disposion of heart and mind</l>
					<l>I went for some time and there by causd the Sisters many anxious</l>
					<l>hours and it was is if I coud not help it tho' much distresd with</l>
					<l>condemnation in my own heart in the year 59 I and two other Girls was</l>
					<l>to go and live in the Single Sisters house I hardly knew how to take this</l>
					<l>as I thought my Self very unfilt in body and mind for it and the</l>
					<l>more as I knew no other but that I should have to work for my living</l>
					<l>by Spinning the went very hard with me for I did not like that work</l>
					<l>at all in Some respects I thought that I should like better than I</l>
					<l>did in the Oeconomey but when it came to it it did not go well</l>
					<l>with me in regard to the forementiond Ocasion, when I saw some</l>
					<l>Sisters admitted the holy Communion which had not been so long</l>
					<l>in the Congregation as I this brought me in a certain concern again</l>

					<l>about my self I had not been long in the Choir house before I got</l>
					<l>a very ill pain in my Side which at last proved a swelling I was</l>
					<l>under the Doctors Hand who tryd all means to keep me but to little</l>
					<l>fever rose I often felt heavy on that acount but still I believd our</l>
					<l>Saviour knew best for what he intended to lay this upon me I there</l>
					<l>fore desired him from the bottom of my heart that he might let</l>
					<l>me feel his grace that so I might bear my pains with Patientous</l>
					<l>and become more resignd according to his heart which he did and I</l>
					<l>believe be had good reason for bringing me in these circumstances</l>
					<l>for as I have since seen that he very likely could not have gain his</l>
					<l>full aim with me May 62 I was recived into the Single Sisters</l>
					<l>Choir which proved a perticular day of grace for me I beg our</l>
					<l>Saviour that he to make me a true Virgin for him and from that time</l>
					<l>on I felt a more eardent disire to became still better acquainted with</l>
					<l>him and get my heart Sprinkld with his blood so that he might</l>
					<l>once atain his full aim with me thus I went on in a confident</l>
					<l>manner relying upon our Saviour as a poor needey Sinner my</l>
					<l>longing and desire after the Communion much increasd but as for</l>
					<l>very sinners about my self this was the reason why I did not speak</l>
					<l>much to my Labours about it but more earnist beg'd our Saviour</l>
					<l>first to prepare my heart for it my Body illness grow worse so</l>
					<l>that I was obligd intirely to take to the Sick room in 63 being</l>
					<l>Maunday <add place="above">Thursday</add> I was made a Candidate <del>I was made</del> for the holy</l>
					<l>Comunion which unexpected grace bow'd me down in the dust</l>
					<l>at my Bridegrooms feet and he was pleased to step before my</l>
					<l>heart in that Figure wherein he did sweat blood in the</l>
					<l>Garden and was naild to the Cross on my account to reddem</l>
					<l>me lost and undone Creature this left an abideing impression</l>
					<l>upon my heart and from that time on I became more chearfull</l>
					<l>happy and contented and my chief desire was to live for our</l>
					<l>Saviour and become according to his mind yea to aford him</l>
					<l>joy for his unweary'd love and patienteous towards me the 30</l>
					<l>of July I had the unspeakable favour granted me to become</l>
					<l>a partaker of his Body and blood in the Holy Sacrament how I felt</l>
					<l>at the injoyment of this my highest I good I am not able to express</l>

					<l>blessings which I have recieved at his hands and he has now made</l>
					<l>all things ease to me ever in gard to my outward circumstances</l>
					<l>so that I have nothing to disturbe my mind with and I am glad</l>

					<l>she had somthing very agreeable which greatly gain her Sisters</l>
					<l>love and tenderness, altho' we must own that yet course thro this</l>
					<l>time has not been as could have wishd, yet it was plainly</l>
					<l>percived that she never was without a feeling from our Saviour</l>
					<l>in her heart which proved an inecouragement to those who had to do</l>
					<l>with her and perticularly in her last illness which she bore with</l>
					<l>great patientious as she believed that by these means our Saviour</l>
					<l>would compleat her for him self 3 weeks before her departer she</l>
