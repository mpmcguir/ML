					<l>The <del>Course of</del> life of the Single Sister Isable Render who departed</l>
					<l>to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> July 25<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1777 in the Oeconomy at Littlemore, and has left</l>
					<l>the following account of herself:</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>I was born at Leeds Sep<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 9<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1756, and bapltiz'd by the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> my Parents
						took</l>
					<l>me frequently with them to the meetings kept by the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> where I had the opportunity of</l>
					<l>hearing of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and his love to poor Sinners, which I lik'd very much at first: but as I</l>
					<l>grew older, I grew ashamed of belonging to the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi>, and wou'd rather have gone to other</l>
					<l>meeting places, that I might have more time to spend with my Companions, but my Parents</l>
					<l>who were resolv'd (if possible) to bring me up for our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, carefully prevented every thing</l>
					<l>which might have been hurtfull to me, as much as laid in their power. In my 12<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year</l>
					<l>I got the small pox, and as I was likely to die, I was fill'd with great fear thinking I shou'd</l>
					<l>not be sav'd if I did, but I pray'd to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that I might get better at this time, and</l>
					<l>promis'd that I waou'd live for him, and he own'd me in a particular manner, and gave me the </l>
					<l>assurance that I shou'd get better and that he wou'd make me happy in him, ever after</l>
					<l>that time, I lik'd very much to attend the meetings at Fulneck and always when I got</l>
					<l>home, and recollected her I had seen the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> there; I felt a great desire to go and live with</l>
					<l>them. March 25<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1769 I was receiv'd into the G Girls Choir, at which time I was very</l>
					<l>happy thinking I shou'd soon go and live with the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, which I did for Ap<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 29 following</l>
					<l>when I came here to the Oeconomy at Littlemoor, where I was soon at home and in my</l>
					<l>element, August 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> that same year, I had the unexpected favour to be recd into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi></l>
					<l>which bowed me before our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and I rejoic'd at my election of grace to be number'd</l>
					<l>with his People, I went on chearfully for sometime, but when our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> shew'd me my</l>
					<l>natural depravity in some measure I was a little surpriz'd, that after I had experienced</l>
					<l>his love in my heart, I shou'd still find things arise in me which was contrary to his h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi></l>
					<l>and mind, but he gave me the grace to speak openheartedly with my S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> which always</l>
					<l>prov'd a comfort, and an abiding blessing to me, and I learn'd to know myself as a poor</l>
					<l>sinner, yet as one that found favour in the sight of my d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who's comforts were never</l>
					<l>a wanting, when I turn'd to him in my distress, May 19<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1770 I was a Spectator at the</l>
					<l> H: Communion for the first time, the impression of what I then felt did not soon leave</l>
					<l>me: the time of my being Candidate was a particular time of schooling for my poor h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi></l>
					<l>but I lost in a great measure the blessing of being openhearted, which together with</l>
					<l>which I felt of my own misery, made me very uneasy; I wanted very much to feel my</l>
					<l>Sins forgiven by our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> but as I constantly strove in my own way for it, I was</l>
					<l>kept dark good while, and did not know what to do once thought, it made no</l>
					<l>matter me staying any longer with the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> I might as will go from <del>which</del>
						<add place="below">whence</add> I came</l>
					<l>for our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was no more to me as he had been, I went on thus</l>

					<l>heavy for some time; but on New Years Night-watch following, our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> drew near</l>
					<l>to my h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> and let me feel that he wou'd yet bring me to a clearness in him, if I did</l>
					<l>but keep close to him, this comforted me, and I grew more chearfull, and now my</l>
					<l>longing to enjoy him sacramentally increas'd, which desire was granted me Oct<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1771</l>
					<l>after which time I was very happy and chearfull in my h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> and liv'd in a close conexion</l>
					<l>with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> daily rejoicing at my happy lot of grace, to be in fellowship with his</l>
					<l>People, and what added to my happiness was, that many of my Choir companions enjoy'd</l>
					<l>the same blessings with me, with whome occasionally I kept many hearty bands about</l>
					<l>my own h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> and our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> kind dealings with me, such opportunitys were a real strength-</l>
					<l>ning and support to me, and that time shall never forget; when many of my companions</l>
					<l>enter'd into the S. S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir I was very much pain'd, as I thereby lost the nearest</l>
					<l>fellowship with them, which had been of so great importance to me, but our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> let</l>
					<l>me feel that my greatest interest was in him, and that he wou'd never fail me.</l>
					<l>Now tho' I had enjoy'd so much from our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Yet it never rightly left my mind</l>
					<l>that I had not as yet experienced his Pardon and forgiveness so clearly as I wish'd</l>
					<l>to do which which I consider'd it made me very uneasy, Yet as I had often strove for</l>
					<l>it, and made myself miserable, I was resolv'd to leave it intirely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to do it</l>
					<l>in his own way, and when he pleased, for I had that confidence in him, that he knew</l>
					<l>my desire, and also how to grant it when he thought best; and one day during the</l>
					<l>preaching I was led to cast my eyes upon our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, as bleeding and dying on my</l>
					<l>account, and what an interview I then had, can never be express'd in words, I felt</l>
					<l>full pardon was merited for me, and everlasting peace and happiness in the blood of</l>
					<l>my redeemer. May 4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1774 I was rec'd into the S Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir, which </l>
					<l>was a particular day of blessing for me, especially when I feasted myself upon his</l>
					<l>Corpse and Blood in the Choir-Communion, and I devoted myself anew to him, that</l>
					<l>he might fit and prepare me according to his own heart and mind, and pray'd him</l>
					<l>to give me his blessing in this Choir also, that he might have some pleasure in me</l>
					<l>for all what he had undergone on my account, and it has always been my prayer to</l>
					<l>him that he wou'd rather take me to himself; than suffer me to be unfaithfull to him.</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>So far her own Words</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>Since her reception into the S. S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> has been very busy in</l>
					<l>discovering to her, her inate corruption, which for want of confidence in him made</l>
					<l>her at times very heavy, and as she pondered over it in herself a good while</l>
				</lg>

					<l>before she disclos'd the state of her h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> to her Labouris, she was thereby greatly</l>
					<l>oppress'd, some of her companions percieving it, wou'd gladly have comforted her, to whom</l>
					<l>she said that she felt more than she knew how to come thro' with, and if she did not</l>
					<l>soon find ease, her burden wou'd be greater than she cou'd bear, but at length our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></l>
					<l>gave her grace to cast herself at his feet just as she was, and she again was com-</l>
					<l>forted thro' the merits of her bleeding Redeemer, after which she said, she enjoy'd a</l>
					<l>truely sabbatic time for her own h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> last December she got a bad cold and Cough</l>
					<l>from which she never rightly recover'd, tho' several means were made use of for that</l>
					<l>purpose, which prov'd ineffectual, when in Ap<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> last, symtoms of a Consumption</l>
					<l>appear'd, she was at first not willing to think of going home so soon, but said she</l>
					<l>wou'd be glad to get better at this time. it was very painfull to her, when on account</l>
					<l>of the cold weather she was obliged to miss the meetings in the passion week, but on the</l>
					<l>last Choir Festival she said that every thing was made up to her, what she had enjoy'd</l>
					<l>from her best friend on that day, wou'd never be forgot by her: and after that time it </l>
					<l>was very perceptible that it was our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> intention soon to hasten his work with her</l>
					<l>which she herself also begun to think, and express'd herself concerning it, to this purpose</l>
					<l>I have had many bands, with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> about going home, and I believe if he takes me</l>
					<l>at this time, tis out of love to me, in order to preserve me for himself &amp; perhaps</l>
					<l>he foresees if I remain below, that I shall prove unfaithfull to him, and because</l>
					<l>I believe he will do with me what he thinks best, I have therefore resign'd myself to</l>
					<l>him, he has already done much for me, and I believe he will help me thro' till my end.</l>
					<l>in this happy resignation she remain'd till her last, and often spoke about the happiness</l>
					<l>of her heart, a few days before her departure she grew a little anxious for fear her</l>
					<l>time wou'd be long, and she was perceiv'd to converse with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> on that hand, and pray'd</l>
					<l>him to give her patience to wait his time, and that he wou'd also bring it soon to pass, after</l>
					<l>which she told those about her, that our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had given her an intimation that he wou'd</l>
					<l>soon fetch her to himself, for which (said she) I am vary thankfull, in the night of the 23<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi></l>
					<l>of July a great Alteration was perciev'd in her, and in the morning (finding herself</l>
					<l>worse) she ask'd the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who attended her, if she was not alter'd; being answer'd in the </l>
					<l>afirmative, she said, our Savr be prais'd for it, now I shall soon see him face to face,</l>
					<l>which she repeated to all who went to see her, she was throughout she whole day so uncom-</l>
					<l>mon chearfull that it was a pleasure to be near her: once, seeing a good many standing </l>
					<l>by her, she said, don't you see how happy and chearfull I am? and don't you feel how near</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> is? O how gracious is he to me, that he is now going to take me to himself to</l>
					<l>secure me from all harm, he has now taken away all old things, and between him and me</l>
					<l>there is nothing remaining, she farther added, I love you all d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> very much, and when</l>
					<l>my last moments comes, I shall like some of you to be present, and help to keep the</l>

					<l>Liturgy at my departure, what a moment well that be, You will then feel how near</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> will be and many more such declarations were given by her, too many to insert</l>
					<l>here; so much we can say with thankfulness to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that his peace was so devinely</l>
					<l>felt, that it was accompanied with blessings to all who were near her, she has already</l>
					<l>told us, that she thought to day wou'd to her last, if not to day (said she) tomorrow,</l>
					<l>which accordingly came to pass: early in the morning on the 25<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> she desir'd to have the</l>
					<l>watchword and Childrens verse read for that day; at hearing she latter she smil'd and</l>
					<l>wanted to hear it again, the verse was, Altho unable to express the tender</l>
					<l>feelings of my h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> by love constrain'd I'll sing and praise my bleeding friend</l>
					<l>till I depart, she said tis very suitable for my going home to day. those who watch with</l>
					<l>her the last night, ask'd her to tell them, if she knew when she was going, which she promis'd</l>
					<l>she wou'd, accordingly about 4 in the morning, she said, I am now going, and signify'd that</l>
					<l>she wanted to be blest for her departure, which was done by her Choir helper during</l>
					<l>a feeling Liturgy according as she desir'd. when that verse was sung. Now thou</l>
					<l>Sister hold dear and tender 'fore her h<hi rend="superscript:true;">rt</hi> display thy splendor, she herself join'd</l>
					<l>in the last lines. Draw it in that <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">cave</hi> cave made for it Soul and Body there</l>
					<l>be buried. being ask'd if the singing shou'd be continue'd, she answer'd, O yes, and soon</l>
					<l>after she said, how is it that I am here yet, but was soon pacify'd when she was told, that</l>
					<l>in a few moments all wou'd be well: and soon after 8 she expir'd softly and happily</l>
					<l>in the 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> Year of her Age.</l>
