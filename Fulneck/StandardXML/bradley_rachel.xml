					<l>The single S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rachel Bradley who hap,</l>
					<l>pily departed this life Aug. 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1809.</l>
					<l>has left the following short account:</l>
					<l>I was born in Goweer in the parish</l>
					<l>of Huddersfield Oct 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1742. Shortly</l>
					<l>before I was born, my Mother began</l>
					<l>to attend the meetings of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>;</l>
					<l>and as soon as she possibly could</l>
					<l>she took me to the meetings too, the</l>
					<l>first time I remember having any serious</l>
					<l>thoughts concerning our Saviour was</l>
					<l>in my 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hauptman</l>
					<l>was Keeping as a Childrens meeting:</l>
					<l>He spoke so movingly about the suf</l>
					<l>ferings &amp; death of our Saviour that it</l>
					<l>made a deep impression on my mind.</l>
					<l>It being Good friday, he told us that</l>
					<l>this was the day when the Lord died</l>
					<l>to redeem us out of the hand of the</l>
					<l>destroyer, telling us to pray to our Sa</l>
					<l>viour to make us good &amp; happy Chil</l>
					<l>dren, and give us a Heart to love him.</l>
					<l>I <hi rend="strikethrough">prayed if</hi> thought, so I will, &amp; prayed</l>
					<l>fervently, so that I felt him very near</l>

					<l>to my heart. Going to Bed at night I</l>
					<l>thought I saw our Saviour, he showed</l>
					<l>me his hands &amp; his feet, and I felt</l>
					<l>such a love to him, that I beg&apos;d</l>
					<l>of him to take me to himself.</l>
					<l>In my 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year my Parents being in</l>
					<l>very low circumstances, my Oncle and</l>
					<l>Aunt payed us a visit, and offered</l>
					<l>to take one of us Children to their</l>
					<l>house, my Aunt fixed her choice on</l>
					<l>me, to my great grief, because she</l>
					<l>had no liking for the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. As</l>
					<l>my Parents insisted upon me going</l>
					<l>I went out of obedience, but spent</l>
					<l>2 very unhappy years. My B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard</l>
					<l>coming from Fulnek about that time</l>
					<l>gave me an oppertunity to aquaint</l>
					<l>him with the uneasiness of my mind,</l>
					<l>I told him that I should never go</l>
					<l>to Heaven if I remained here. He</l>
					<l>asked me where I should wish to</l>
					<l>be? I answered any where among the</l>
					<l>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. My inclination was to live</l>
					<l>with the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, but could not see</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>how it was possible to be brought about.</l>
					<l>Being one Night very uneasy, I kneel</l>
					<l>ed down by my bed, and prayed</l>
					<l>to our Saviour with many tears, that</l>
					<l>if is was his mind for me to live</l>
					<l>with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> he would make it</l>
					<l>known to me, by putting it into</l>
					<l>my Mothers heart, to come and see</l>
					<l>me, that I might tell her all</l>
					<l>the trouble of my mind; to my</l>
					<l>great surprise she came next mor</l>
					<l>ning, I was struk, and thanked <add place="above">to</add> the</l>
					<l>Lord, because I knew it was his doing.</l>
					<l>When she asked me how I did</l>
					<l>I answered; very well! she said she</l>
					<l>was glad to hear it, for she suffered</l>
					<l>much on my account the last night</l>
					<l>&amp; could have no ease of mind till</l>
					<l>she knew what was the matter</l>
					<l>with me. I inquired about her re</l>
					<l>turn, she told me in the afternoon,</l>
					<l>I took no farther notice, but dressed</l>
					<l>myself to go with her, on seing what</l>
					<l>I was about she wished me not to</l>

					<l>do it, saying my Father would be much</l>
					<l>displeased, not withstanding I set</l>
					<l>out, but my Mother using all manners</l>
					<l>of persuasion for me to remain where</l>
					<l>I was, I told her that I could not</l>
					<l>return, unless she spoke with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>Pyrlaus concerning me, which she faith</l>
					<l>fully promised to do, &amp; I returned to my</l>
					<l>Oncle &amp; Aunt who rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> me gladly, telling</l>
					<l>me that I was beloved by them as</l>
					<l>their own Child. I thanked them for</l>
					<l>their Kindness towards me, but aquaint</l>
					<l>ed them with nothing farther. My</l>
					<l>Mother fulfilled her promise, spoke</l>
					<l>to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; they soon found a place</l>
					<l>for me, my S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came to fetch me</l>
					<l>&amp; I felt very thankful to the Lord</l>
					<l>for what he had done for me.</l>
					<l>The next day we came to Little town</l>
					<l>where I remained for a short time,</l>
					<l>from thence I obtained leave to live</l>
					<l>in Gummersal S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House, and after</l>
					<l>living 2 years there, I removed to </l>
					<l>Fulnek. Now indeed my heart was</l>
					<l>melted before our Saviour, seing with</l>

				<lg>
					<l>what unwearied Kindness &amp; patience <hi rend="strikethrough">our</hi></l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">Saviour</hi> he has followed me, I shed</l>
					<l>sinner tears before him, and intreated</l>
					<l>him fervently to keep &amp; protect me</l>
					<l>during my pilgrimage here below;</l>
					<l>&amp; I must own to his praise that he has</l>
					<l>never left nor forsaken me, I feel my</l>
					<l>self a very great sinner, but hope thro&apos;</l>
					<l>his enabling grace I shall give joy to</l>
					<l>our Saviour &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I my 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></l>
					<l>year I had the favour to be rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></l>
					<l>into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which proved a great</l>
					<l>blessing to my heart. But now the</l>
					<l>depravity of human nature began to</l>
					<l>show itself more &amp; more. I felt a great</l>
					<l>inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this</l>
					<l>world &amp; often thought of going back &amp;</l>
					<l>leave the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; I grew also very re</l>
					<l>served, so that I could not open</l>
					<l>my heart to any one. But my ever</l>
					<l>faithful Saviour <add place="above">followed</add> me his poor Child</l>
					<l>with unwearied Kindness &amp; made it</l>

					<l>had manifested himself to me in his</l>

					<l>forgiveness of all my sins. I now</l>
					<l>returned home happy and comfort</l>

					<l>without reserve I could open my</l>

					<l>I own and feel myself as the poorest</l>

					<l>at the same time, that this short acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></l>
					<l>given of her early life had been the</l>
					<l>most remarkable to her, and the period</l>
					<l>in which she sought &amp; found real</l>

					<l>who has been her refuce in all trouble.</l>
					<l>As she loved &amp; was beloved it was a pleasure</l>
					<l>to her to be in her room with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> as</l>
					<l>long as she was able to go down, but about</l>
					<l>3 weeks before her departure she was obliged to</l>
