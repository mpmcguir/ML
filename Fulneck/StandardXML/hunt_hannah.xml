				<lg>
					<l>The Course of Life of the Great Girl Hannah Hunt</l>
					<l>I was born in Gomersal in the parish of Birstol in</l>
					<l>the year 1755, removed with my parents to</l>
					<l>Fulneck 1760, by which means I had the opportunity</l>
					<l>of going to the Childrens meeting which was a</l>
					<l>great favoar to me &amp; also a Great satisfaction</l>
					<l>to my dear parents when I behaved orderly and</l>
					<l>well, but alass it was too <add place="above">much</add> <del>often</del> the case otherwise</l>
					<l>my Lightmindedness often deprived me of the</l>
					<l>injoyment of the congregation Days which was</l>
					<l>at Times a real mortification to me &amp; made me</l>
					<l>examine myself more sollomly then I surely</l>
					<l>should have done, had I been sufferd to go on</l>
					<l>with out reprose,</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>March 25 by I was received into the great girls choir</l>
					<l>from which Time I became more thoughtful over the</l>
					<l>miss spent time in My Childrens years, &amp; wishd to conduct</l>
					<l>myself for the future more to my saviours mind,</l>
					<l>which occasion'd an Earnest desire in me to live amongst</l>
					<l>the Girls in the Choirhouse into which place I had</l>
					<l>the Grace to enter the following month of august</l>
					<l>with a real desire to devote soul &amp; body to live to my dear</l>
					<l>Saviour, beging Him to forgive me all my former disobedience</l>
					<l>&amp; make me a true poor sinner according to His own Heart</l>
					<l>but after all my Good resolutions, I had not the Grace to be</l>
					<l>open Hearted nither to my Labourers nor room companions</l>
					<l>so that I came into a real dryness &amp; indifferece of Heart to </l>
					<l>the Calls of Grace &amp; also the blessing I might have injoyd</l>
					<l>amongest the dear Girls, who as well as the Sisters, felt</l>
					<l>great pain &amp; concern over my poor Salvation; which brought</l>
					<l>me upon more serious reflection &amp; I began to be more incurably </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_16HuntHannah-02.jpg" n="2"></pb>

				<lg>
					<l>convinced of the great danger I was in, so that I became</l>
					<l>very Heavy &amp; much disstresst &amp; seeing one and another</l>
					<l>of my room companions received into the congregation</l>
					<l>I was brought by such occasions to look afresh into</l>
					<l>my own Heart &amp; beg with the Tenderest Tears of my</l>
					<l>dear saviour what He wou'd bless me &amp; make <add place="above">help</add> me <add place="above">to be</add> more</l>
					<l>open Hearted then Hitherto, for I now felt more than I was</l>
					<l>able to bear, &amp; I felt the Grace &amp; confidence that He</l>
					<l>wou'd look upon me His poor child --</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>March 27 1769 I was received into the congregation </l>
					<l>which was a great blessing &amp; merited the Tenderest &amp; most</l>
					<l>Humble adoration my poor Heart was able to return' thus</l>
					<l>fare or own words.</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>from This Time was Observed a particular work</l>
					<l>of the Holy ghost. Her close &amp; reserved disposition had</l>
					<l>caused Her Laborers many uneasey hours as no</l>
					<l>Traces of Thankfulness, cou'd be preceived Either for</l>
					<l>Her liveing in the choirhouse or the care &amp; nursing</l>
					<l>bestowd upon or that she injoy'd ought pleasing</l>
					<l>in the fellowship amongest the girls, she now became</l>
					<l>more freindly &amp; open Hearted &amp; spok in a sinnerlike</l>
					<l>&amp; blessed manner over Her whole course &amp; going</l>
					<l>on, &amp; that Her present Sickness was a real blessing</l>
					<l>to Her, it being a slow wearing, which gave Her an</l>
					<l>oppertunity of seeing several depart out of this Time</l>
					<l>dureing Her abode in the sickroom which caused Her</l>
					<l>many Tears, Especial one of Her room Girls namely</l>
					<l>anna Joh<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> Gambold, whose corpses she beg'd to have brought </l>
					<l>to Her bedside before she was carried out, of the sickroom</l>
					<l>Ah <add place="above">she</add> cryd when will my Happy hour come, I used I cou'd not</l>
					<l>bear the thought of dieing, but now all that Timouressness</l>
					<l>is departed from me &amp; I can Heartily wish My Saviour wou'd</l>
					<l>take me to Himself, being one day observd weep in silence</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l><add place="above">and</add> askd The occasion she answerd I was reflecting How</l>
					<l>blind I shou'd be if my dr savr wou'd permitt me to be a candidate</l>
					<l>but my weakly Tabernacle cannot be present at any such</l>
					<l>oppertunity; but pray think of me, she was disired not</l>
					<l>to make it Heavy to Herself but wait satisfied our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></l>
					<l>Time &amp; love &amp; long for Him with Her whole Heart;</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>On July 10 she was acquainted that our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had granted</l>
					<l>Her request in being candidate for the Holy communion <add place="above">&amp; also a participant</add></l>
					<l>she burst into a flood of Tears &amp; Expressd much love and</l>
					<l>Tenderness to Her dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for bestowing such Grace</l>
					<l>upon so worthless a Creature as she was, &amp; said I have</l>
					<l>often spoke &amp; Heard it spoke about the sinnership</l>
					<l>but I never knew in all my Life what is was to feel</l>
					<l>it in my Heart till I came upon my sickbed, indeed; its</l>
					<l>quite a different thing to feel it then only to say I am a</l>
					<l>sinner I will and shoud be a sinner, thanks be to my dr</l>
					<l>Lamb who has given me the Grace to feel thus Happy a</l>
					<l>midn all poverty &amp; weakness; &amp; askd if she might</l>
					<l>communicate this the knowledge of this favour she</l>
					<l>had to be a candidate &amp; <add place="above">a participant to</add> Her sick companions who</l>
					<l>Heartily rejoiced with Her, &amp; waitd with impatience the</l>
					<l>Happy moment of this great injoyment; &amp; dureing the</l>
					<l>Sacrament which she &amp; another of Her sick companion</l>
					<l>injoyd for the firt Time, there was an inexpresable</l>
					<l>feeling of the nearness of her unseen freind, whom Her</l>
					<l>longing spirit wish soon for to Embrace, &amp; she continued</l>
					<l>in a Joyful Expectation of seeing Him face to face who</l>
					<l>had thus Sacrementaly prepared Her for His arms &amp; bosom</l>
					<l>in the Midst of the Knowledge of Her own poverty and</l>
					<l>wretchedness she as attain'd thro' grace in His merits</l>
					<l>to close Her period in this Time during the blessing of </l>
					<l>Her choir &amp; Enterd into Her Eternal rest July 20 1769</l>
					<l>&amp; in the 14 year of Her age, </l>
