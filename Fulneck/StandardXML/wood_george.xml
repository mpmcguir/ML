							<l>Departed Feb 3, 1761</l>
							<l>Personalia of the single B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Wood, who in his sick room</l>
							<l>left the following Acc<hi rend="superscript">t </hi>of himself.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>I was born at Holbeck in the Parish of Leeds August 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1735</l>
							<l>My Father was a native of Ireland &amp; my Mother a Yorkshire Woman.</l>
							<l>When I was about 2 years old my Father left my Mother to Care</l>
							<l>for herself &amp; Children &amp; went into Ireland. My Mother brought</l>
							<l>me up as well as she could, but on Account of Poverly was not</l>
							<l>able to give me any Schooling, the Loss of which I have experienced</l>
							<l>the most since I come amongst the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>; for as I had not learn&apos;d to </l>
							<l>read, I was deprived of that Opportunity which my B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> have, of</l>
							<l>entertaining themselves, with reading something agreeable about</l>
							<l>our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, in their sabbatic Hours: But this Loss has been suffic-</l>
							<l>ciently restored by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in granting me his precious</l>
							<l>Nearness, whenever I wept for him!</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>In my Youngest Years, I was a Child of a quiet Disposition,</l>
							<l>and liked best to be alone because when I happened to come into</l>
							<l>the Company of other Children, something generally occurred</l>
							<l>about which my Mind was uneasy afterwards, I therefore kept</l>
							<l>chiefly <hi rend="superscript">by</hi> to myself &amp; often took a Walk alone, feeling my Mind</l>
							<l>most easy and chearful in this Course.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year, I was put apprentice to my Uncle Stancliff</l>
							<l>who was then amongst the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, to be a Clothier &amp; the first Sunday</l>
							<l>he took me with him to Grace Hall, on which Day I felt something</l>
							<l>powerful in my Heart from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>., What I heard &amp; felt had</l>
							<l>such an Effect that I could not miss one Meeting afterwards</l>
							<l>to which I was allowed the Priviledge of going. I soon got ac-</l>
							<l>quainted with dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Held, who gave me Leave to go to all the</l>
							<l>Childrens Meetings, Bands &amp; Classes, which proved a real Blessing</l>
							<l>to my Heart. &quot;When I was about 14 Years old I was rec<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>amongst</l>
							<l>the great Boys by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth from which Time I attended</l>
							<l>the Boys Meetings diligently &amp; with Pleasure not obtaining any</l>
							<l>Thing particular in Mind or Body to what I had done in my</l>
							<l>Childrens Years, but felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> near my Heart, &amp; was well</l>
							<l>in the Meetings of the Boys; yet during all this time tho&apos; I felt</l>
							<l>very well, I had not a real &amp; solid Connexion &amp; Conversation</l>
							<l>with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as a Sinner, which afterwards was made clear to me.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>In any 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year I begun to perceive my natural Depravity and</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Corruption pretty strongly, promting me to things which I know very</l>
							<l>well were against the Mind, <del>of</del> &amp; Heart of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, but has <add place="above">not</add> sufficient</l>
							<l>acquaintance with Him &amp; Foundation in my own Heart to make the</l>
							<l>right Use of him in these new Circumstances, &amp; was therefore brought</l>
							<l>into Darkness &amp; great Perplexity of Mind, so that I was sometimes</l>
							<l>very dubious how it would at last End with me, yet <del>the</del> in the</l>
							<l>bottom of my Heart I had a real desire to be helped into a happy</l>
							<l>clear Track but my greatest Misfortune was a false shame, which</l>
							<l>caused me to conceal <del>the</del> my true Condition &amp; the Cause of my Differences</l>
							<l>from my labourers, but being frequently visited <del>by</del> at that time</l>
							<l>by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Renatus, he perceived I was not so clear &amp; lively as usual &amp;</l>
							<l>wanted to know the cause, but which I avoided telling, till I could</l>
							<l>hold out no longer, being compelled by the great Misery of my Heart</l>
							<l>to disclose every thing wherewith I was bound &amp; entangled, &amp; which</l>
							<l>indeed proved very happy for me in its Consequences. I then could</l>
							<l>&amp; did speak with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in a sinnerlike, confident Manner, &amp; often</l>
							<l>times fell on my Face before <add place="above">him</add> &amp; wept bitterly, till He melted my</l>
							<l>Heart with his Nearness &amp; rich Forgiveness, &amp; cheared me with his</l>
							<l>friendly look. I then resolved to devote my Soul &amp; Body just as</l>
							<l>it was to him, &amp; to speak quite openheartedly with my Labourers</l>
							<l>about all my Circumstances for I felt the sweets of it, &amp; since I</l>
							<l>made that Resolution it has been my constant practice to my sur:</l>
							<l>prising ease &amp; Blessing. From this time, I have had a happy Con</l>
							<l>nexion with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I went every Night into the Fields after I</l>
							<l>had donemwork to speak with the Friend of my Soul, whom incom-</l>
							<l>parable Nearness &amp; presence always met me, so that my Eyes &amp; Heart</l>
							<l>were often overflowing with gratitude, on Account of what he had</l>
							<l>done for &amp; manifested to me. My concern about the Preservation</l>
							<l>of my Soul &amp; body was often the Subject of my Conversation with Him</l>
							<l>&amp; therefore I pray&apos;d him with Tears to make a Way for me to the Choir House</l>
							<l>for I felt no place else in all the world could satisfy me. Some Weeks,</l>
							<l>after I was loose of my Apprenticeship, I had the Joyfull</l>
							<l>News brought me that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had given me Leave to come I live</l>
							<l>in the Choir House which Grace I accepted of with thousand thanks</l>
							<l>to my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, who thus graciously heard &amp; granted my Request</l>
							<l>&amp; soon after I came with Joy &amp; gratitude of heart into my beloved</l>

							<l>Choir house in my 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year July the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756, and Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>: the 22<hi rend="superscript"
									>d</hi> the</l>
							<l>same year had the Grace to be rec&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to my inexpressible</l>
							<l>Joy, and went the first Fine to the holy Communion with my clear Single</l>
							<l>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at a Choir Communion June 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1757 whereby my highest Wish</l>
							<l>next to that of seeing &amp; embracing him bodily was granted me, &amp;</l>
							<l>which I shall never forgot.</l>
						</lg>

							<l>About Easter in the Year 1759 a <del>gathered</del> Humour <del>came</del>
								<add place="above">fell</add> into</l>
							<l>one of my Feet &amp; broke out in a running Ulcer whereby I was</l>
							<l>incapable of earning my bread for a long Time. I made Use of</l>
							<l>many things &amp; also by Advice went to the how, not without long</l>
							<l>&amp;effect the areal here was not wrought by any thing I tried of</l>
							<l>did for tho it healed one quarter it broke out the next &amp; now a Con-</l>
							<l>sumption <del>came</del>
								<add place="above">added</add> thereto, so that I have a near Prospect of soon</l>
							<l>kissing the Points in Hands and feet for my Grace Election</l>
							<l>I wait in my Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hands &amp; Friendship with ardent Desire</l>
							<l>the happy End of all Complaint when I shall grow pallid</l>
							<l>in Jesus Arms &amp; Lap.&quot; So far his own account.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>To which we will only add, that his course amongst us from</l>
							<l>first to last has been as a <add place="above">youth</add> of God, solid, steady &amp; annointed.</l>
							<l>and his Heart past has <del>has</del> lived in a tender uninterrupted connexion</l>
							<l>with the Man of Sorrows, so that it was always a pleasure to keep Band</l>
							<l>with him. We kept his Hearts object constantly in View &amp; suffered</l>
							<l>nothing to disturb him in the Enjoyment thereof, so that we have</l>
							<l>had no Grief, but always Joy over him, &amp; some Years <add place="above">since</add> when the</l>
							<l><add place="above">situation of</add>
								<del>it looked precarious with</del> many of our young Single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
								<add place="above">seemed very precarious</add> he was</l>
							<l>not in the least disturbed thereby in his happy Track, but cleaved</l>
							<l>the more closely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; was heartily glad of &amp; thankful</l>
							<l>for his election.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l><add place="above">From the time that</add>
								<del>After the above mentioned</del>
								<add place="above">His</add> Sickness would not permit him to receive</l>
							<l><del>work</del> any longer <del>at</del> he busied himself with such little</l>
							<l>Matters as he could do in the House &amp; which he did with Faithfulness</l>
							<l>&amp; Pleasure as long as he could, &amp; till he betook himself entering </l>
							<l>to the Sick Room. Here he enjoyd a perfect Sabbath in the Nearness</l>
							<l>of his bleeding Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. It was a Pleasure to visit him &amp; speak with</l>
							<l>him abt. our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. He never liked to hear any thing about his reco-</l>
							<l>very but wish'd <add place="above">that</add> his happy Hour <add place="above">might soon</add> strike. He was patient in his Sickness</l>
							<l>to Admonition for said he, our Savr&apos;s Nearness makes my Sickness tolerable &amp; Happy.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>&amp; <add place="above">was</add> thankful to his Brn, as also to to his Sick Waiters for every Thing he</l>
							<l>enjoyed. <del>At</del> the last <add place="above">time he was spoken with</add>
								<del>Speaking</del> before the Communion he said I think </l>
							<l>this will be the last Time I <add place="above">shall</add> enjoy His Corpse Blood here &amp; when </l>
							<l>it was brought to him he enjoyd it with great Devotion &amp; a particular</l>
							<l>aweful Feeling attended it.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>The 2 last times he Class was kept he decided it might be in his </l>
							<l>Sick Room, which was granted. he told his Class B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> that his longing </l>
							<l>to be with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was the only Concern he now had and entreated</l>
							<l>them to beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to hear him soon. Feb 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> he was so very</l>
							<l>weak that we expected him soon to go Home. His Heart&apos;s Situation and</l>
							<l>Longing to go home was charming and pretty: Love verses were sung</l>
							<l>for him &amp; tho he could speak no more yet he gave signs with a </l>
							<l>most lovely childlike Aspect &amp; said at the end of every Verse, moor.</l>
							<l>Feb the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> betwixt 3 &amp; 4 in the Morning he called to his Sick Waiter</l>
							<l>&amp; wanted to get up. Upon being ask&apos;d Why? he answered, &quot;I am not</l>
							<l>yet at Home, I want to go home to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.&quot; He was told that</l>
							<l>our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> would soon come &amp; take him to himself which he </l>
							<l>was <add place="above">much</add> pleased to be assured of, &amp; thus he continued quite unfit</l>
							<l>to his last Moment when about 8 o&apos;Clock his Friend beckon&apos;d</l>
							<l>to him, &amp; he grew pale in Arms &amp; Legs wiht the Blessing</l>
							<l>of his Choir during the singing the Word &quot;And now his </l>
							<l>Mouth expiring on thy dear Breast recline &amp;c and with </l>
							<l>these fine Tents, <hi rend="underline">The Sparrow hath found an House, and </hi></l>
							<l><hi rend="underline">the Swallow a Nest.</hi> lit: Tent. <hi rend="underline">With my Spirit within me</hi></l>
							<l><hi rend="underline">I seek thee early. My Saviour, Ah! was I with Thee.</hi></l>
							<l>The Feeling attending his Separture was inexpressible, &amp;</l>
							<l>caused the Eyes of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn </hi>presant to overflow, our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
							<l>was indeed there tho our Eyes could not see Him yet the</l>
							<l>Feeling testified it sufficiently.</l>
