							<l>went home Feb 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770</l>
							<l>The course of Life of the Single Sister Grace Thornton</l>
							<l>I was born at Mirfield Nov<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>r 8 1736 Bap<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> on the Church of England</l>
							<l>haveing heard of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> from My infancy, I had a desire to go unto</l>
							<l>the meetings but my mother thought I was too young, but one day I ventured</l>
							<l>of my own accord &amp; stay<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the whole meeting took Care to be at home before my</l>
							<l>mother, fearing she wou&apos;d be grive&apos;d, but when she heard of it was Much pleased.</l>
							<l>&amp; from that Time always took me with Her. &amp; whrn I was about 8 year old I was</l>
							<l>took into Care amongst the Child<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Helt. I liked the Childrens
								meeting</l>
							<l>&amp; also the school kept by the Sisters proved a great blessing to my Heart,</l>
							<l>in My 14 year I was took into the Gr Girls choir &amp; Heartily wish I might be a joy</l>
							<l>to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. after My fathers departure I removed with my mother to live in</l>
							<l>Holm Lane that we right be nearer fulneck to injoy the meetings, &amp; about</l>
							<l>my 18 year I had the Smallpox in which sickness I was brought to reflect upon</l>
							<l>how my hearts stood with regard to its connection with our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for I found</l>
							<l>my self much afraid of dying feeling my depravity of soul &amp; body &amp; that</l>
							<l>I had no assurance of going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in my present situation, I laid my</l>
							<l>self as well as I cou&apos;d at His thro&apos; pirc&apos;d Feet for this gracious absolution &amp;</l>
							<l>the friend of Sinners took my fear away &amp; made My sickness more bearable to me</l>
							<l>on the 13 of nov<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 54. I was received into the congration to My great Joy and</l>
							<l>deep abasement renewed my Covenant to be in soul &amp; body my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></l>
							<l>&amp; I continued Happy &amp; chereful for some Time, &amp; in April the following</l>
							<l>Spring I was admitted a candidate for the holy sacarement to the blessing</l>
							<l>of my Heart, for it brought me upon being more Earnest with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
							<l>to prepare me for the injoymont of His body &amp; blood, but this I carried too</l>
							<l>far in My own Strength &amp; self working, &amp; thereby came into deep</l>
							<l>distress, my own depravity laid such hold of me that I had no</l>
							<l>more the Sight or feeling of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My heart &amp; became cold</l>
							<l>and indiffrent to all the former promises which I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> made Him</l>
							<l>&amp; I got a love for the world &amp; the pleasures which I saw other young</l>
							<l>people injoy: thus with forming various Ideas of delight unto myself</l>
							<l>I went to bed one might seamingly well pleased, <add place="above">w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></add> my proud &amp; High dispossition</l>
							<l>to conceal all these imaginary pleasures to my self &amp; I thought to sleep as</l>
							<l>at other Times but I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sooner laid me down my pleasures vanishd</l>
							<l>&amp; such distress came upon me that I spent the might in the bitteres Tears</l>
							<l>Crying our for mercy but felt no Sinner in My heart. this desstress</l>
							<l>continued so long that I thought it more then possable ever to survive it</l>
							<l>with My Senses; one day I retired unto a lonely place, fell upon My</l>
							<l>face &amp; My heart burst into a flood of Tears at My dear Lords Feet</l>

						<lg>
							<l>where I wou&apos;d gladly have said Lord have mercy on me! But I cou&apos;d not Speak,</l>
							<l>but Here found that fremd of Sinners nearer to my soul than ever I had</l>
							<l>felt before, He forgave His poor disstressd Creature &amp; set me free from</l>
							<l>all the Sin &amp; Guilt that stood before me, &amp; my Heart became as a little</l>
							<l>Child before Him; &amp; on april 16, 56 to I was confirmed for the injoyment</l>
							<l>of the Holy Saccrement &amp; in May following participat&apos;d of that Highest</l>
							<l>good in an Expressable manner as a poor pardond Sinner prostued before</l>
							<l>Him &amp; I injoy&apos;d many blessings in the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Great Girls Choir.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>June 10 1757 I was receivd into the Single Sisters Choir here a new schooling</l>
							<l>commened in My heart &amp; I begd my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to take me afresh into His hand</l>
							<l>&amp; make me a true virgin thro&apos; His own precious blood, for I felt a</l>
							<l>daily need of Grace &amp; absolution</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 14 1758 I got leave to live at Gomersal Oeconomie at which</l>
							<l>place I was soon at Home much rejoic&apos;d at <add place="above">my</add> happy lot felt chereful</l>
							<l>&amp; Glad to live amongst the Sisters &amp; <add place="above">to</add> feel there Hearts Love for me;</l>
							<l>may 1760 I had leave to remove into the choirhouse at fulneck, which</l>
							<l>rejoiced me very much, beliveing I was removed from all danger</l>
							<l>&amp; had now got a Lasting home till I <add place="above">shod</add> enter into My Everlasting rest</l>
							<l>not long had I injoyd all these great &amp; Gracious previlidges but</l>
							<l>I began again to feel myself that needy one for whom there was</l>
							<l>no help but at the Feet of Jesus, to which place I had many by petty</l>
							<l>before He cou&apos;d get this poor sheep His poor blood bought worm to stoop</l>
							<l>So low &amp; when I think of this what I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">ve</hi> injoyd at that dear place</l>
							<l>my poor Thanks are far too short for all the Toil &amp; Labour that I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">ve</hi> cost him</l>
							<l>about one whole year in My Choirhouse I injoy&apos;d a Happy Saboth <del>for my</del></l>
							<l><del>Heart,</del> &amp; then came into great coldness &amp; indiffrency of Heart towards our</l>
							<l>dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; my Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> whom I thought did not Treat me according to my desirts</l>
							<l>&amp; instead of being a Sinner over My faults I grew High in Spirit &amp; brought</l>
							<l>myself into Such Circumstances as I never felt myself before beleiveing</l>
							<l>it impossible to come thro&apos; as I percived I had intirely lost the Sinner Tract</l>
							<l>therefore resolved to keep it all a secret in My breast &amp; take an opper<add place="above">tunity</add></l>
							<l>to leave the House in private by walking out alone;</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>thus on setting out I resolved never to see the choir house more &amp; to</l>
							<l>turn My back upon all the hardships which I found too <add place="above">much</add> for to submit</l>
							<l>on my first steping out the Tears begun to flow plentifuly down My cheeks,</l>
							<l>&amp; every step seam&apos;d to pierce my very Heart; I had not walk<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> above</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>a quarter of a mile but I was struck so with fear &amp; Trembling that I cou&apos;d not</l>
							<l>approach one step further &amp; a voice came so to me was those words, if thou</l>
							<l>goest away thou will be ruind in soul &amp; body; turn again &amp; I will</l>
							<l>bring the through, I look<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> round me but coud see no person but felt</l>
							<l>the near presence of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My Heart;</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>I return&apos;d with all speed unto My dear choirhouse with a <hi rend="underline">Thankful</hi></l>
							<l>&amp; <hi rend="underline">chereful</hi> Heart unto My dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for His great fauthfulness</l>
							<l>in helping of me Back &amp; after haveing deprived myself of 4</l>
							<l>months injoyment of the holy saccorement I was on the 12 of march 61</l>
							<l>admitted to that great grace again to my never deep forgotten abacemerst</l>
							<l>&amp; from this Time I become more open Heartd to my Labourers as I</l>
							<l>had never been before to My great loss &amp; shame &amp; pain.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Thus far her own words. The particular grace our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviour bestowed</l>
							<l>on our Happily departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> makes us adore the friend of Sinners</l>
							<l>Who with unwearied Patience follows his poor helpless Worms; Convicts</l>
							<l>&amp; comforts; alternately; according as the poor deprav&apos;d nature can</l>
							<l>bear it; this was the Case with our Late Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> who did not like</l>
							<l>the searching love of her Lover, but had a secret inclination</l>
							<l>thro Pride to hide her faults; Which Stagnated her Course in the</l>
							<l>Injoyment of the Blessed Sinnoers Fellowship with her Choir Sis<hi rend="superscript">trs</hi></l>
							<l>The Sencible feeling she had of it at the same time may be</l>
							<l>seen by a few lines; which she her self Composed</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>I have so often gone astray</l>
							<l>And would seek help some other way</l>
							<l>Till I into great Danger came</l>
							<l>Which made me cry out for a Lamb</l>
						</lg>
						<lg type="stanza" n="2">
							<l>May I on Thee my Surest Rock</l>
							<l>Now fix my faith I nor from thee look</l>
							<l>I know from thee my health does</l>
							<l>When I around Thee Cling (Spring</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Her Favourite Verses were the Late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Christol&apos;s &amp; in particular</l>
							<l>That Hymn; With Sainfull Pennance thoughts Distressed</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>The Soul of my Belov&apos;d I See &amp;c.</l>
							<l>Whereby a tender Emotion of heart towards her Suffering Redeemer</l>
							<l>was very Persceptible in her; Oct<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> ye 9 she remov&apos;d into the sickroom</l>
							<l>which prov&apos;d a Blessed school to her; Which Our Saviour made up</l>
							<l>of to his own purpose, in delivering her from all her self delusion</l>
							<l>as well as from the painfull Sensation Occasion&apos;d by imposing on</l>
							<l>her Constitution about which she was truly poritent; And thro&apos;</l>
							<l>his Grace set her at Liberty from all porplexity, which had</l>
							<l>intrrupted her Course of Grace so manny years; This She expressed</l>
							<l>to her Labouresses with <add place="above">that</add> aimiable, absolv&apos;d Sinners Beauty;</l>
							<l>as Bespoke a Serene Dignity &amp; Clearness with the Friend of</l>
							<l>Sinners; in such a meltedness of injoyment that all about her</l>
							<l>partook of her happiness</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>From that time Our Saviour gave her the grace to relish &amp; injoy</l>
							<l>His Bleeding Merits, to her comfort and Satisfaction; and supplied</l>
							<l>all her wants richly; she had for some time past a secret</l>
							<l>intimation that her stay here wou&apos;d not be long, at which</l>
							<l>She rejoic&apos;d Like a child; at that Blessed Meeting when she</l>
							<l>Should see our Saviour, but her disorder having hung on her</l>
							<l>for some years being something astmatical we did not think</l>
							<l>it would be so soon; till about a week ago, she alter&apos;d</l>
							<l>porceptibly &amp; begun to speak with firm assurance, that her</l>
							<l>Hope wou&apos;d soon come to the full Injoyment, She thank&apos;d &amp;</l>
							<l>Prais&apos;d Our Saviour night &amp; day for His Love &amp; Goodness</l>
							<l>and often repeated. O my own dear Saviour how shall </l>
							<l>I poor worm thank Thee enough; It is impossible for me</l>
							<l>to tell what He has done for me; Soon I shall have</l>
							<l>the favour to See Thee &amp; kiss these dear wounds which</l>
							<l>have heal&apos;d me; In this Happy Expectation she ended her</l>
							<l>dying, &amp; all Porplexity, Comforted &amp; reconciled, on the 12<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></l>
							<l>between 1 &amp; 2 oclock <add place="above">in the after</add> noon with the Blessing of her</l>
							<l>Choir in the 34<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of her age.</l>
