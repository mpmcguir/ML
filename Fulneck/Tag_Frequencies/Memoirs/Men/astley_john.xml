						<persName ref="#mlper000547">John Astley</persName>, for it is usual amongst

					<p> It was the First <name event="communion">communion</name> which was kept in
							<placeName>Fulnek Hall</placeName> however be that as it will, it was
						the first to him in That Place, and Numbred with Him; amongst his particular
						Hours of Grace! From that Day: He has maintain&apos;d His communion with the
								<orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> to his Dying
						Hour, tho&apos; it was often times, but slenderly &amp; and with difficulty
						yet it never ceas&apos;d realy.</p>
					<p> They were <name event="marriage">Married</name> in the year <date
							when-iso="1733-02">1733 in Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></date> and
						had a 11 Children 5 of whom are in the <placeName>Burying Ground</placeName>
						in <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulnek</placeName>; one in
							<placeName>Hartshed Church</placeName> yard, one Daughter, at <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000035">Dukenfield</placeName>, and one at
							<placeName>Ockbrook Choir House</placeName>. and the other three i.e.
						one Son, and two Daughters don&apos;t belong to us. they had once a little
							<orgName en="Å“conomy">oeconomy</orgName> of <orgName>Single B<hi
								rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> at their House in
							<placeName>Hartshed</placeName>, but this was not their own but the
								<orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> Projecting, but
						as it did not answer our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> &amp; the<orgName> B<hi
								rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> purposes it was soon Given up
						again.</p>
					<p> He has been her Some years, a pretty good <name office="steward"
							>steward</name> and Servant of the little <orgName en="congregation"
								>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> in <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000059">Mirfield</placeName>, and so has also His present
						Widow, and therefore his Memory must remain Dear to us. He was a Child of
						Grace indeed, yet <hi rend="underline">his life was Chequer&apos;d o&apos;er
							with Grief and need.</hi></p>
					<p> His Domestick affairs have bore a very indifrent Trace these Many years, by
						which Means his credit was reduced considerably; and this not only with
						Strangers, but partricularly So among our own People, therefore I am rather
						inclin&apos;d to Draw a vail over the Most part of his Life. than to Expose
						it to Publick view.</p>
					<p> However: all is Well, what End<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Well. altho the
						beginning and Middle had Some thing deploreable yet the end was adoreable. I
						have labour&apos;d upon it from the beginning of his Sickness to get his
						Mind off from all Eaternal concerns, as he could Mend nothing in it, &amp;
						entreated Him </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> to Fix his heart and Eyes on our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> and on his <add place="above"
							>all</add> atoneing Sacrifice, which advice he took Child-likely and
						became quite composed, and Chearlul in his Mind. we visited him pretty often
						in order to keep this Matter alive in his heart which has happily Succeeded
						on <date>Easter day</date> he Send for me, accordingly I wwent with 2 more
							<roleName type="honorific">Brethren</roleName> Pray&apos;d heartily by
						Him, kept a little liturgy, by his Bedside, &amp; gave him my last Blessing,
						thinking he could not live till I could come again. this little visit was
						attended with a most blessed feeling, So that I left him with a Heart quite
						Satisfy&apos;d.</p>
					<p> on <date>Easter Tuesday</date>, I and my Wife went to See him once more I
						was quite Edify&apos;d with his look &amp; Spoke tenderly to him, and Sung
						Some Suitable verses for him, in which he join&apos;d with us which we could
						see by the moving of his lips, this was the last happy little visit, for:
						the next Monday Early, he fell Softly and Happily asleep in his 58<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> year. </p>
