				<persName ref="#mlper000550">John Hugh</persName> who Departed <date when-iso="1772-05-22">May 22d 1772</date> has dictated the
					<hi rend="underline">folloing concerning his Life</hi></p>
					<p>
					I was born at <placeName>Frestrup</placeName> in the <placeName>Parish of Pembrokshire</placeName> <date when-iso="1741-02-06">Febr 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					1741</date>, &amp; lived with my Parents till <date when-iso="1748" cert="medium">I was 7 years of Age</date>; about this
					time <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Cennick</persName> came into this Country &amp; Preached the Gospel,
					my Mother who went frequently to hear him, took me with her
					which I liked. When a <name event="religious">Childrens Meeting</name> was begun, I had the
					Grace to be one of them who attended it, which proved a <name type="emotion">blessing
					to me</name>, for there I got the first Impression of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love.
					<persName><roleName type="honorific">Esq<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Roach</persName> of <placeName>Clarison</placeName> being a lover of the Gospel &amp; a friend
					of Children he settled a School, to which I also was taken, but I
					having no Genius for learning, did not bring it far, yet by frequent
					hearing the Versses out of the little Hymn Book which he had bought
					for the Children, I learned many of them by heart &amp; <name type="emotion">delighted in
					singing them</name>. Our Master who was a very good Man, used to sing
					Verses before &amp; after Meals of which the following made a particular
					Impression upon me: We thank the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for this our Food; but more
					for <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> Flesh &amp; Blood the Manna to the Spirit giv&apos;n the living Bread
					sent down from <placeName type="biblical">Heav&apos;n</placeName>. At Nights our Master used to kneel
					down with us, &amp; oftens pray&apos;d very heartily that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> might
					preserve us from every bad thing &amp; lead us in the way to everlasting
					Life. We Children kept also Meetings among ourselves &amp; when we
					went into the Fields, we sometimes kneel&apos;d down under the Hedges &amp;
					pray&apos;d to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in a Childlike simple manner. When I was about
					<date when-iso="1753" cert="medium">12 years of age</date> I went to <name event="religious">Service</name>, where I had it very hard, nor did

					I get enough to eat. <date when-iso="1755" cert="medium">After 2 Years</date> I went to another place, where I
					had it better in outward respects, but was much exposed to bad and
					hurtful Company, so that I lost those good Impressions which I had
					as a Child, &amp; a Desire for the World &amp; is Vanity took place in me.
					When <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">I was about 19 Years old</date>, one of my former Masters wanted
					me to enter again into his Service, with whom I also agreed, &amp; as
					I learn&apos;d afterwards, a Scheme was laid, that if I had come there,
					I very likely should have settled &amp; been entirely lost in the things of
					this World; but before the time came quite on, I went to see my
					Mother &amp; Sister, who persuaded me to go &amp; work as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name> on the
					Fortification, which was then to be build, tho&apos; I never had been employ&apos;d
					as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name> before, but I got Tools &amp; went, &amp; the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> to
					whom I pray&apos;d, helped me, so that I could go on with the work &amp; there
					by all Dangers, which awaited me, if I had gone again to Service,
					were prevented. Living now with my Mother, she asked me to go with
					her to <name event="religious">divine Service</name>, which I did, as I had no particular Choise in
					this Respect. After I had been to hear <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Nyberg</persName> several times he spoke
					to me &amp; invited me to call &amp; see him, which I did the Sunday after, when
					we had had some Conversation together, he told me, that now the
					<orgName>Society</orgName> would have a meeting &amp; I might be present; As soon as I
					entered the Room, I was seized with <name type="emotion">an holy awe</name> &amp; the praying
					of the Litany in that Meeting made such an Impression upon me
					that I not only looked upon them as true Children of <persName type="deity">God</persName>, but became
					also seriously concerned about myself. I then went to the <name event="religious">Meeting</name>

					every Sunday &amp; in my return, I oftens pray&apos; d to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to
					<name type="emotion">make me happy &amp; give me the assurance thereof in my heart</name>.
					I had still some Difficulties on account of my former Connexions
					but my faithfull <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> help&apos;d me thro&apos; &amp; made me free from them all .
					As we lived about 3 Miles distant from <placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, &amp; my
					Mother was not so well cared for as I could wish, I took a House
					&amp; moved with her to <placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName> where we lived happily together.
					<date when-iso="1765-05-12">May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1765</date> I was <name event="reception">received</name> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> which I
					esteemed very highly. In general <name type="emotion">I have had a very happy time</name>
					&amp; had many a Visit from our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in the Converse with him; As well
					in my Sleeping place, as when I took a walk in the Fields &amp; once
					in particular when I walked by the River Side, He appeared to my poor
					heart &amp; assured me that I should be His &amp; that he has shed his Blood for
					all my Sins; <date when-iso="1768-03-31">March 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1768</date> I was made a partaker of our <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName>
					Flesh &amp; Blood in the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name>, Ah! how thankful mn I
					for all the Grace our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> has bestow&apos;d upon me, how often has He drawn
					so near to me, that I have melted into Tears, when I have been praying
					or speaking to him, these were happy Times, which I shall never forget.</p>
					<p>Thus far his own words.</p>
					<p>
					When <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Petrus</persName> was in <placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, he desired &amp; obtained leave
					to come to <placeName ref="mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; arrived here <date when-iso="1768-08-28">Augst 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1768</date>. His course here has
					been Edifying &amp; to our Satisfaction, he always expressed a great
					Regard for the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, but when he saw or heard any thing unbecoming
					in any one, who lived in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, he did not rightly know how to
					take it, yet our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> always reminded him to look to himself &amp;

					to dwell upon the faults of others &amp; thereby farther hurt was
					prevented. He oftens expressed a Desire to serve our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, &amp; some
					time before his <name health="disease">last Sickness</name> begun; he declared to his Labourer:
					That he had devoted himself quite a new to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> &amp; his People,
					was quite satisfied as &amp; where he was at present, but if our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
					would give him a Call to any other place or employ, if he but
					knew, it came from Him, he would accept of it with all
					his heart. <date when-iso="1771-12">Last December</date> <name health="disease" type="cold">he got a bad Cold</name>, which turned
					to a <name health="disease" type="fever">severe Cough attended with a Hectic Fever</name>. He expressed
					a Desire to go to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, but said, that he was not clear, if
					it would be now. The Medicine he took had but little affect
					yet we thought, the warm wheather &amp; some gentle Exercise
					might perhaps be a means of his recovery, &amp; when it was prac-
					ticed, it seemed to have a good effect, so that about 3 weeks ago
					he thought still, that he would be able to take a Journey to <placeName>Wales</placeName>
					&amp; fixed the day for his setting out, which proved to be the day of
					his happy Departure. Eight Days ago his Sickness took a turn,
					when it appeared, that his time here would be but short, &amp; when
					the <name occupation="doctor" memoirSubject="no">Doctor</name> told him so, he was exceeding glad of it &amp; waited with
					resignation for his Desolution; a little before his Departure, a
					<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> said to him: that now he would soon be with our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> and
					appear before him in his Blood &amp; Righteousness, upon which he answered
					Ah! that is pretty, if I had no <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, what should I do now? In this
					Comfortable Disposition &amp; with a Reconciled heart he went to his <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName>
					in the <date when-iso="1772" cert="medium" type="death">31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Year of his Age</date>.
