						<persName ref="#mlper000553">Joseph Carr</persName> has left the following
						account of himself.</p>
					<p> I was born in <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1764-08-27">Aug. the 27<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> 1764</date> of poor Parents &amp; <name event="baptism"
							>baptized</name> by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>,
						I used constantly to attend the <name event="religious">public
							preachings</name> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>,
						till my Father put me <name occupation="apprentice">apprentice</name>; <date
							when-iso="1777" cert="medium">when I was about 13 years old</date>, to
						one <persName>Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Harrison</persName> a <name
							occupation="tailor">Taylor</name> at <placeName>Stanningly</placeName>,
						where I got acquainted with a neighbour, which proved a great detriment to
						me: when his wife died, he used to get me to keep his house for him, as he
						was a <name occupation="shopkeeper">shopkeeper</name>, while he went to the
						markets; &amp; on Sundays he would take me with him to public houses, &amp;
						into unprofitable company, so that at last it became quite indifferent to
						me, whether I went to any place of worship or not as my acquintance cared
						for the expense, &amp; I began to consider myself as my own master, I paid
						no regard to any admonitions, that were given me, but I thought I had met
						with a very good Companion. My master in particular used to tell me, that he
						hoped I should See the time, when I should <add place="above">think</add>
						him not my friend, but I treated this observation with disregard &amp;
						slighted what he said, because he was a methodist. When I was loose from my
						Master, having lived with him 7 Years, I continued to go in in my old
						course, keeping company with my friend (as I then looked upon him) the above
						unprofitable acquaintance. <date when-iso="1785" cert="low">About a year
							after I had left my Master</date>, it pleased our <roleName
							type="honorific">Savior</roleName> to visit me with a <name
							health="disease">heavy sickness</name>, so that no one thought I should
						recover. I made a promise at that time, that if ever I got better again, I
						would forsake my wicked ways &amp; turn as a poor Sinner to our <roleName
							type="honorific">Savior</roleName>, but alas when <name
							health="recovered">I got well again</name>, I went in as before, forgot
						entirely my promise, &amp; associated again with my former hurtful
						Companion. </p>

					<p> my <name relation="sister">Sister</name> who belonged to the <orgName

						tried to persuade me be attend the <name event="religious">preaching</name>
						at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>, when she went thither.
						I went once with her on a Sunday in the afternoon, when I heard the late
							<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</roleName>
						<persName>John Miller</persName> ??? read some accounts concerning the
							<orgName en="congregation">Indian Cong<hi rend="superscript"
							>n</hi></orgName> in <placeName>North America</placeName>, &amp;
						afterwards keep a Discourse. I was struck at hearing how much sooner the
						poor <name type="Indigenous">Indians</name> were brought to the Knowledge of
						our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> than such a wicked man as
						myself. <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName> Miller</persName> came down after to see my <name
							relation="sister">Sister</name> &amp; as I was at work in the same room
						he addressed himself to me, &amp; after speaking in a friendly way with me
						he invited me to call &amp; I see him. I went down after, &amp; made known
						to him my desire to join the <orgName>Brn</orgName> &amp; soon after I was
							<name event="reception">received</name> into the
							<orgName>Society</orgName>, &amp; became acquainted with the <name
							office="labourer">Sing B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Labourer</name>,
						&amp; used to spend the time between the meetings in the <placeName>S. B<hi
								rend="superscript">rns</hi> house</placeName>: I little expected
						then, that I should once come &amp; live in it as I considered it to be too
						high a favor for such a great Sinner, as I then felt myself to be; I got
						leave also to come to the <name event="religious">Choir meetings</name> on
						Sunday mornings, which was a <name type="emotion">real blessing to
						me</name>. <date when-iso="1790-03-29">March 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> 1790</date> I came to live in the <placeName>B<hi

							>abiding impression upon my heart</name>. <date when-iso="1791-12-14"
								>Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 14 1791</date> I got leave to be
						an Inhabitant of <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>
						<name type="emotion">to my great Joy</name>, &amp; on the 26<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> of dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I was
							<name event="reception">received</name> into the <orgName
							en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> &amp;
						since then, tho&apos; trials have not been wanting; our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> has
						sanctified them, a help&apos;d me thro&apos; them all, for which I cannot
						sufficiently thank him: and I trust he will continue to lead me on to the
						end, poor &amp; needy as I am.</p>
					<p> Thus far our late <roleName type="honorific">Brothers</roleName> our account
						of himself.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1772-06-02">June 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1772</date>
						he was <name office="spectator">Spectator</name> at the <name
							event="communion">holy Comunion</name>, &amp; <date
							when-iso="1772-08-29">aug 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date>
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p> he partook with us of the <name event="communion">Comunion</name>. For some
						years past <name health="disease">he has been sickly</name>, &amp; in <date
							when-iso="1793-03">march last</date>, it appeared as if his <name
							health="disease">complaint would terminate in a Consumption</name>: his
							<name office="labourer">Laborer</name> adds concerning him: He was a
							<roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName> of few words, but the
						feeling attending what he said, as well as the earnest desire, which he
						often expressed during his <name health="disease">Sickness</name> to go to
						our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>,
						showed clearly, that <name type="emotion">he loved him</name>: being once
						asked, whether he thought he should see the beginning of an other year? his
						answer was: no our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> has made it
						clear to me, that I shall go before the next <name event="communion"
							>Comunion</name>. He departed gently &amp; happily <date type="death"
							when-iso="1796-12-05">dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1796</date> &amp; is now at rest.</p>
					<p> In some papers found after his departure, he writes under <date
							when-iso="1791-11-13">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1791</date>. <name type="emotion">This
							was a very blessed day to my <add place="above">poor</add> soul</name>
						our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> let me see what a
						thoroughly depraved &amp; Spoiled Creature I am &amp; that without him I am
						nothing but Sin &amp; misery, but thanks he to his name for the blessings,
						which I receive from him from time to time: <date when-iso="1792-08-29">aug
								29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1792</date> I partook of the <name
							event="communion">Holy Comunion</name> for the first time: I cannot
						express in Words, what a nearness of our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Savior</roleName>&apos;s love to poor Sinners I then experienced. I
						began the <date when-iso="1793">year 1793</date> trusting in our <roleName
							type="honorific">Savior</roleName>&apos;s merits, &amp; praying him to
						keep me ever in remembrance of his death &amp; sufferings endured on my
						account a poor Sinner, thanking him likewise for the many favors &amp;
						blessings I had received at his hand in the year past. <date
							when-iso="1793-08-27">aug 27 1793</date> (being his birth day) now I
						begin an other year: O <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, be near
						to me, &amp; let me have thee in my mind both day &amp; night, I pray. </p>
