							>Lambshill</placeName> in <date when-iso="1753">1753</date> there often
						appeared something of the dear Mo thers Labour upon his Heart, particularly
						when his curiosity of which he had a great share led him upon searching into
						things which he was afterwards shy in speaking about. In this course he went
						on, and his Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> were often very mich distressed
						on his Account, and full of fears lest his want of uprightness and openness
						would make his course heavy to himself and painful to our <roleName

					<p> one who had to do with him but he laboured under an <name health="disease"
							>impediment in his Eyesight</name> which often pain&apos;d him and made
						him dis pair sometimes of ever learning to work as he should do </p>
					<p> In <date when-iso="1759-11">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1759</date> he
						was one of those Youth when our dear Johannes has been very orderly ever
						since he came into the <placeName>choirhouse</placeName>, always showing
						Obedience to his <orgName>Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> and
						esteeming that as highly necessary both in himself and others. Those 3 or 4
						Months past he has been much more concern&apos;d for a lively Heart, and
						spoke of it with more feeling than formerly, was also more clear and open
						&amp; had a more real connexion with our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Savr</roleName>. In the begining of his <name health="disease"
							>Sickness</name> which was towards the <date when-iso="1761-04">latter
							end of April</date>, he did not think much of going home, nor did he
						desire it much because his heart was not in so tender to situation towards
						our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> as it could &amp; should be.
						Several serious bands were kept with him, whereby he discovered a
						sensibility not observed in him before. The 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
						Instant he altered, told a Labourer he knew he was much concern&apos;d on
						his Account, and not without Reason, for said he <name health="disease">my
							heart has not been so lively as it should</name>, but be not
						distress&apos;d or troubled about me, perhaps you may think it would not be
						agreable to me to go home, but I can ease you on that Account, and assure
						you my concern comes not from that Corner, whenever he calls me he will take
						one to himself, I am his &amp; shall certainly go to him, this is a clear
						and made out matter to me, but my concern is that my heart is not more
						lively and warm &amp; that I have not enjoy&apos;d his precious nearness as
						I could and should have done. This Conversation was sattisfactory. He also
						spoke with our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> from that time in a more Sinnerlike but confident
						manner as long as he was able to speak, &amp; also told his Labourers and
						other <orgName>Brn</orgName> he now knew he should go home this time
						express&apos;d also a desire after it. At last it was <name health="disease"
							>very difficult for him to speak</name> but when visited did all in his
						power to render himself intelligible </p>
					<p> and particularly to express himself about going home. The <date
							when-iso="1761-05-07">7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> in the
						Morning he expressed again his desire to go home so as to be understood,
						&amp; about 11 at Night his Sickness took such a turn that it was thought he
						would go directly. </p>
					<p> From this time he took very little notice of any person or thing about him
						but lay quite still seemingly without pain till the <date
							when-iso="1761-05-09">9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> (that ever
						memorable day) in the evening while the <orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName> was enjoying the <name event="communion">holy
							Communion</name>, about 1/2 an hour before his de parture he came quite
						to himself, was very sensible of his pain, but not able to speak, &amp; 3/4
						past 9 while the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> prostrated he was
						deliverd into the hands of his <roleName type="honorific"
							>Redeemer</roleName> in a peculiar tender manner, to whom he breathed
						out his spirit with the bles sing of his Choir, &amp; during the singing of
						several Verses in his 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year </p>
