						<date when-iso="1772-02">February 1772</date>
						<persName ref="#mlper000564">Christian Bell</persName> was born in

								7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1742</date> and came as a little Boy
						into the <orgName en="Å“conomy">Children&apos;s Oeconomy</orgName>, he was a
						very lovely Child, beloved by all about him. When he arrived to his Boys
						Age, he
						<!-- Asked question in Google Doc whether this is a specific age or range of ages -->
						was put apprentice to our dear late<roleName type="honorific"> B<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000544">Charlesworth</persName> in the <name
							occupation="merchant">Merchant Business</name>, during which time be
						behaved himself as an orderly &amp; faithful Apprentices, and gave full
						Satisfaction to <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000544">Charlesworth</persName> &amp; others about him.
						I was evident that there was a Work of Grace in his Heart, be those who were
						acquainted with him were in Hopes that he would not only prosper &amp;
						become a happy <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName>, but that he
						would also be useful in our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> kingdom, In these Years he was
						very openhearted &amp; seemed to have no other Concern than to be formed by
						our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						quite according to his Mind &amp; to live for His alone in the World.</p>
					<p> The was <name event="reception">received</name> into the <orgName>Cong<hi

						<date when-iso="1766-03-27">March 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							1766</date> he was admitted to the <name event="communion">holy
							Communion</name>, but which had not the wished for Effect. Soon after he
						went to <placeName ref="#mlpla000054">London</placeName> where the Snares
						laid for him caught a surprizing Hold of him &amp; a love to the World </p>

					<p> took place in him, so that his Soul rec&apos;d a Hurt at this Time which was
						never rightly cured again till a little while before his Departure.</p>
					<p> After he set up Business for himself, it obliged him &amp; to make some
						Journeys to <placeName ref="#mlpla000054">London</placeName>, where
						Temptations were renewed, to draw him altogether into the World, and
						altho&apos; the Staff of Corruption &amp; strong tendencies thereto lay in
						him, yet he felt such Strong Convictions, that he never could come to a
						Resolution to go into the World, yet this divided Heart &amp; continual
						Struggle betwixt our <persName type="deity">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></persName> &amp; the World caused him a heavy &amp; truly
						unhappy Life that one could not see and speak with him without being moved
						with compassion. A Times he was much concerned about his unhappy State of
						Heart &amp; wished our <persName type="deity">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persName> might attain his Aim with him; he also was some
						times very sensibly Struck with the strong proofs he had of our <persName
							type="deity">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></persName> Faithfulness
						to him &amp; by seeing how He kept his Hand over Him. This had the effect
						upon him that he once in a particular Manner pray&apos;d our <persName
							type="deity">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persName> if He saw no
						other way of obtaining his Aim with him to do it by giving him a sickly
						Habit of Body, <add place="above">or taking him to himself</add> rather than
						suffer him to go into the World, &amp; he has often considered our <persName
							type="deity">Sv<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></persName> Dealings with
						him as an Answer to this Prayer. <date when-iso="1771-08" cert="low">About a
							half a Year ago</date>, as he was going to Leeds &amp; had still
						thoughts of pursuing a Worldly Scheme, tho&apos; with much uneasiness of
						Mind &amp; Having pray&apos;d as above, he stop&apos;d &amp; looked back for
						his Company when he got a Vomiting of blood, which was the beginning of his
						last Sickness.</p>
					<p> About <date when-iso="1771-12" cert="medium">2 months ago</date> it was
						observed that his tender </p>
					<p> and weakly Constitution turned into a <name health="disease"
							>Consumption</name> &amp; he declined very fast. He was frequently
						visited by many <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></roleName>, for he was generally beloved, &amp; when it drew
						nearer his End that he himself begun to think, he would soon go home, he
						spoke with <name type="emotion">great concern</name>, to Some of the
						Labourers whom he had most Confidence in &amp; had been best acquainted
						with, and Lamented that he had spend much of his Time so poorly with
						Reasoning, Reading unprofitable Books, neglecting the Meetings &amp; other
						privileges of the <orgName>Congregation</orgName>, he also said that he
						never had experienced the true Grace in the Blood &amp; Merits of Christ

						<hi rend="strikethrough">our <persName type="deity">Saviour</persName></hi>

					<p>
						<hi rend="underline">This brought him into such Distress that he
							thought</hi> he would be lost. Two Nights before his Departure, <add

						<hi rend="strikethrough">when he was</hi> yet pretty strong, he wept &amp;

						Comfort from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. From that Time his Fear
