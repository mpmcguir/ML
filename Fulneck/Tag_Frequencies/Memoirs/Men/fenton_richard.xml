				The Course of Life, of the <roleName type="honorific">great Boy</roleName> <persName ref="#mlper000556"><hi rend="underline">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton</hi></persName>

					<persName ref="#mlper000556">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton</persName>, Son of our <roleName type="honorific">Br</roleName> <persName>Richd Fenton</persName> was born

					As a Child he went to the <placeName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> School</placeName> at <placeName>Lane
					End</placeName> where he learn&apos;d till he was <date when-iso="1769" cert="medium">12 Years old</date>. In <date when-iso="1769-06">June
					1769</date> he was bound <name occupation="apprentice">Apprentice</name> to <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> <persName>John Spicer</persName>
					to learn the <name occupation="glover">Glover&apos;s Business</name> &amp; came at the same
					time to live in the <placeName>Choir House</placeName>, where he went on in a
					still &amp; quiet Course to the Satisfaction of his <orgName>Brn</orgName>
					In the following Year he <name health="disease">began to be sickly</name>, &amp; as all
					endeavours for his recovery proved ineffectual, <name health="disease">he grew
					weaker &amp; weaker from time to time</name> &amp; as his Parents
					lived near, it was propos&apos;d to him to go and live with them
					whereby he might enjoy more of their Parental Care &amp;
					Nursing; but he declin&apos;d it. However as he grew more
					helpless, he, in the <date when="1772-06">beginning of last July</date>, agreed to go
					&amp; be with his Parents, where he has enjoyed a happy
					&amp;  sabbatical time waiting with Patience &amp; Resig.
					nation when it would please our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to take him
					into his eternal Joy &amp; Security. He was now &amp; then
					visited by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> to whom he declared that altho&apos;
					he was resigned to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> yet he know that it would

					his Health, &amp; live here still longer. He had an Impression
					of our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>&apos;s love towards him, which made
					him look &amp; pray to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> with Confidence. When
					he was visited by <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> whom he was accquainted with,
					he desired that they might sign sing some Verses with
					him, &amp; several Times he mentioned in particular that
					the following should be sung: I am a poor Sinner, yes 
					&apos;tis true I am &amp;c. He came here to the Meetings as long
					as he was able to walk, or ride, which always seem&apos;d
					to be a refreshment to him, &amp; when he was no more able
					to come to the meetings, he was <add place="above">very</add> Sorry for it, especially
					when he thought that he should not have the pleasure
					to attend the meetings on <name type="holiday">Christmas Eve</name>, on which
					account he propos&apos;d that a couple of <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> should earry
					him to the <placeName>Hall</placeName> in a Sedan; But on the <date when-iso="1772-12-19">19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></date>
					in the Night, he had such a gracious visit of our
					<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that he became quite satisfied, with his not
					being able to come to the meetings on <name type="holiday">Christmas Eve</name>,
					for when he got up in the Morning &amp; dressed himself
					he began to speak to his Mother about it &amp; told her there
					had happened an alteration with him last Night
					when she asked what way, he told her that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
					<note type="catchword">had</note>

					had been very <add place="above">near</add> to him &amp; he had kept a band with him
					about every thing, &amp; our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> had forgiven him all &amp;
					would take him soon to himself. He also said: &quot;I gave
					myself quite anew to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, &amp; he accepted me as
					his own Child, Believing his time would be short, he
					desired that his <roleName type="honorific">Srs</roleName> in the <placeName>Choir House</placeName> might be
					sent for, to tell them how happy our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had 
					made him, &amp; that he would soon take him to himself
					to be happy &amp; to live with him forever. Since this
					time <name health="disease">he grew weaker so fast</name>, that one could see the
					time of his Departure came on very quickly. Some
					Days before his going home, his Master came to
					see him, &amp; when he was going to leave him, he reached
					his hand to his Master &amp; thanked him for all the 
					love &amp; favours he had shewn to him, telling him
					he very likely might never see him any more in this
					World, &amp; so it came to pass, for on <date type="death" when-iso="1772-12-29">Decr 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 1772</date>
					in the Moming his Soul took its Flight, to that
					God, who had created &amp; redeemed him &amp; made him
					so happy by his precious Nearness, in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					Year of his Age.
