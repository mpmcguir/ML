						shall soon be go home, but don&apos;t be troubled for you will not stay long

					<p> Heart and observing his Wife looked thoughtfull, he said to her when I am
						with him I will speak a good Word for you, that he may soon fetch you also
						and I&apos;m sure he will not deny me my Request and this he comforted her
						about their parting. Soon after the <name event="sacrament"
						>Sacrament</name>, being visited by a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> he
						express&apos;d his great Longing for that highest Good, in order to
						strengthen his heart under the great bodily pain he felt and declared that
						the better Death and Passion of the <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName>
						<persName>Jesus</persName> was what his heart rely&apos;d upon and his its
						only Good for time &amp; Eternity. Once being visited he express&apos;d his
						Desire to be buried with his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> at <placeName>Lambs Hill</placeName> and seemed
						grieved that on account of his outward Circumstances he must give up that
						hope but he was soon comforted upon our assuring him we wou&apos;d see to it
						that his desire shou&apos;d be accomplish&apos;d. <date
							when-iso="1761-01-21">Jan 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></date> he had

						to hasten the ripening of this fruit of his Deaths Agony &amp; take him home
						to himself or soon enable him to appear again among his <orgName>B<hi

						thy nail holes see his Pardon &amp; Election free &amp;c. Give him
						absolution, and a gentle praising Tone, deep Foundation in thy Cross&apos;s
						Stem, and then during an inexpressible tender &amp; melting feeling he
						receiv&apos;d his share of the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacram<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi></name> after which he was particularly
