						<roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> Grace, he once during a <name
							event="religious">Preaching</name> of <persName ref="#mlper000536">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Inghams</persName> became particularly
						happy, thro&apos; the <roleName type="honorific">holy Ghosts</roleName>
						applying the Word to his heart. When <persName>M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Spangenberg</persName> went about settling Societies in
						these Districts he became a Member of the same. He having a great Love for
						the <orgName>Church</orgName> he was brought up in and being now more clear
						in what one went properly to divine Service for, he continued going to
						Church for a long while believing that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> blessed him there like wise.
						But as his Heart could be no more satisfied without Fellowship, and he not
						meeting with it there, this determined him to follow solely and alone the
						Track our dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Might lead him among the
							<orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, in which Resolution he was very steady,
						untill he was <name event="reception">recieved</name> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, which
						came to pass <date when-iso="1748-08-13">Augst 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1748</date> on account of which
						Grace he was very much melted and thankful. <date when-iso="1748-11-13">In the same Year, namely the

							rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> to the <name event="communion">holy Comunion</name> for the first time, and
						as he has never enjoy&apos;d it before in his Life time out of a profound
						Respect he had for the same, His Heart was so much the more bowed on account
						of this great Grace and concerning which he said: No Tongue is able to
						express the feeling of my Heart, that such a poor Worm as me, is permitted
						to enjoy this highest Treasure. This Awefull Impression of the <name event="sacrament">holy
						Sacrament</name> abade with him to the End of his Life. An accidental Circumstance
						proved the Occasion to determine him and his Wife to spend the Remainder of

						have his dwelling, which was <date when-iso="1759-05-12">May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759</date>.
						His Grace Election was very important to him and which he kept continually
						in his Eye, and when he had the Favour to become <name office="disciple">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
							>n</hi> Disceple</name>, which Dignity he was twice invested with, his heart
						was so humbled and broken because of the Sense of his unworthiness that he
						went to his <name relation="son">Son</name> <persName>James</persName>, entreated him to assist him in praying our dear
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that His Intention with him might be
						obtained. In his Course and Walk, this in a Measure unobserved, he
						enjoy&apos;d much of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love and Grace,
						and so as he grew weaker and feebler in his Body his Tenderness towards his
						<roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> encreased, and his Longing to be soon with him grew more ardant. He
						was often seen weeping when by himself, and if asked what was the Cause of
						at, he said: <name type="emotion">These are not Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Love to my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName></name>.
						When he was the last time at the <name event="communion">holy Comunion</name> in the <placeName>Hall</placeName>, he had an
						Intimation of it that this would be the last time he should enjoy that
						greatest of Blessings here below; But heartily wished that he might have no
						long and serious sickness in order not to give his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> any trouble, which Request be clear <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> granted him like wise:
						for when on the <date type="death" when-iso="1759-12-16">16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec.</date> he went to Bed
						about 9 o&apos;Clock in the Evening, he slept till about 1 o&apos;Clock in
						the Morning, and at 2 o&apos;Clock his Soul </p>
