				<hi rend="underline">Memoir of the late <roleName type="honorific">Rev.</roleName> <persName ref="#mlper000558">Thos. Grinfield</persName></hi>
					The very thought of writing any thing like
					a memoir of myself the poorest among the 
					<roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> poor ones has produced a thrilling senssation,
					so that after its composition, I have more
					than once consigned it to the fire. But as my
					high Calling of <persName type="deity">God</persName> in <persName type="deity">Christ Jesus</persName>, &amp; the events 
					previous to my fellowship with the <orgName>Brethrens Church</orgName>
					and strikingly marked with
					the divine finger, I durst not refuse to reord
					to the Glory of <persName type="deity">God</persName> a brief narration of
					the special circumstances that principally
					bear on these two points.</p>
					<p>
					It pleased <persName type="deity">God</persName> that I should draw my first
					breath in the house of my parents at <placeName>Salisbury</placeName>
					<date type="birth" when-iso="1748-04-02">Apr 2d. 1748</date>. Much as I wish to honour
					the memory of my dear father &amp; mother,
					yet from the most credible information
					they canot be considered in any other
					view than as refined deists. Moral as was
					their character before men; they were immical
					to divine Revelation &amp; its doctrines; 
					&amp; as a consequence at times showed their
					aversion to all in every demonination
					who professed the simple doctrine of

					of the <name type="religious">Gospel</name>. The question may now
					be asked, how could the children of parents
					thus disposed expect to be brought up in
					the fear &amp; nurture of the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>? Much as they
					might wish to instil morality on their
					sinful minds, their general education
					would have been according to the Philosophical
					axioms so prevalent at that period.
					I was the youngest of three brothers; the
					eldest went early to <placeName>Winchester school</placeName>, being
					designed for the Bar. The second to
					<placeName>Westminister</placeName> for the army. From <date when-iso="1755" cert="medium">seven
					years old</date>, I was a day scholar at the <placeName>Cathedral
					Grammar school</placeName>, &amp; had my
					father lived till I had reached <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">twelve years</date>
					was to go to <placeName>Winchester College</placeName>.</p>
					<p>
					I must now revert to the awful
					events which under Providence led to the
					opening of the <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> gracious purposes
					with me. In <date when-iso="1759">1759</date> it pleased <persName type="deity">God</persName> to remove
					both my honoured parents within
					9 weeks of each other, my mother of
					a <name  health="disease">consumption</name> in July; my farther in
					Octr of a <name health="disease">gouty spasm on the heart</name>
					while conversing with me after dinner
					on my going to <placeName>Winchester</placeName> <name type="holiday">next Easter</name>

					such awful bereavements are frequently 
					Mendid with incalcuable loss to minors,
					but my all merciful <persName type="deity">God</persName>, caused them in
					the signal to work for my educational gain.
					For <hi rend="underline">He who knows the end from the begin-</hi>
					<hi rend="underline">ning</hi> saw me (a poor orphan) <hi rend="underline">lying on</hi>
					<hi rend="underline">my blood</hi>, (spiritual death) without any
					to pity my forlorn case. Thank <persName type="deity">God</persName>, I am
					now in my <date when-iso="1824" cert="medium">76<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year</date>, &amp; enabled to believe
					that my time of love was come. This
					thoughts of peace concerning me were gradually
					to be fulfilled, that my lost &amp;
					dead soul should live by faith to Him on
					her earth &amp; when his good work in me
					should be finished, live with <roleName type="honorific">Christ</roleName> in
					his <placeName type="religious">glorious kingdom</placeName>. O most unworthey
					am I of these ever blessed prospects.
					Since the call of an immortal soul from
					death to life &amp; from darkness to light in
					the most important by all events, no
					incident combined with its spiritual
					progress, trivial as it may appear to
					carnal wisdom will be deemed so by
					by him, who has ears to hear &amp; eyes to
					see, with a heart to understand the mysteries
					of the kingdom of <persName type="deity">God</persName>.

					In my father&apos;s will to guardians were
					appointed, his only brother &amp; one of my mother&apos;s
					Brothers. The first immediately
					entered on the change. The whole landed
					property was left to our eldest brother
					with small fortunes to the younger children.
					My uncle aware that mine was
					by no means sufficient to pursue my
					honoured father&apos;s intention for the Church
					determined to take me to one of the most
					respectabile schools at <placeName ref="#mlpla000030">Bristol</placeName>. His friends
					in this city mentioned the late <roleName type="honorific">Rev.</roleName> <persName>W.
					Foote</persName>, who taught latin &amp; greek before
					in the mornings. After dinner Writing,
					Arithmetic, &amp; the rudiments of Geometry
					were taught by the <name occupation="usher">Usher</name>. Here I was
					entered about Michaelmas following.</p>
					<p>
					The leading reason of my being settled
					here instead of <placeName ref="#mlpla000054">London</placeName>, was that my excellent
					&amp; truly pious <persName>Aunt Anne</persName>, resided
					in <placeName ref="#mlpla000030">Bristol</placeName> &amp; was on the point of
					joining the <orgName religion="Moravian">Moravians</orgName>. In this event 
					the divine finger is most evident. In

					The Sunday&apos;s and half yearly vacations were
					generally spent under her roof. My Aunt
					occasionally touched in a very delicate
					manner &amp; suited to my capacity on divine
					vine subjects, particularly of the histories
					of <persName type="biblical">Joseph</persName> &amp; <persName type="biblical">Samuel</persName>. My ears were
					then quick to hear the words, new as
					they seemed, yet the dulness &amp; hardness
					of my heart prevented me from comprehending
					their spiritual import.</p>

					After many months she pressed me to
					accompany her to the <placeName>Chapel</placeName>. Unpleasant
					reports of the <orgName>Moravians</orgName> had
					been instilled into my ears by the elder
					boys of the school. These added to
					the natural enmity of my heart to
					serious subjects urged me to refuse
					to go anywhere except to the <placeName>parish
					church</placeName>. Near two years had elapsed
					before my Aunt, having some ladies
					belonging to the <orgName>Brn</orgName>, in her house, requested
					me to attend her now &amp; then to

					The evangelical style was so new to my
					ears, &amp; the place &amp; people so contrary to Church
					regulations, that I scarcely understood the
					drift of the sermon, nor was I pleased with
					the mode of worship. My Guardian seriously
					thought of my learning the Italian
					method of Book keeping to prepare me
					for a merchants Comfiting house. In
					<date when-iso="1762">1762</date> he placed me with an excellent Master
					who was to devote 2 or 3 hours a day in
					hearing me read the Classics in which
					I had made good proficiency. This Gentle-
					man&apos;s academy was near the chapel I
					began to attend very frequently with the

					ly caused of the inattention to the warnings
					of the <roleName type="honorific">Holy Spirit</roleName> &amp; from a desire to 
					rise in the world, deferring the salvation
					of his soul to a future period, ignorant
					how suddenly the thread of mortal life
					may be snapped by <persName type="deity">God</persName> in whose hand
					are the timer. His tears &amp; heartrendings

					upon the <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> for the remission of
					all his sins &amp; follies in his all cleansing

					departure, the good &amp; faithful <roleName type="honorific">Shepherd</roleName>
					graciously assured him of an interest
					in the great mediatorial sacrifice. By
					this manifestation his spirit became
					comforted &amp; resigned his redeemed soul
					into the hands of his <roleName type="honorific">Creator</roleName> &amp; <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName>.
					The deep impression made by the Spirit

					&amp; fastening the door <name type="emotion">kneeled down by the

					forth my finest prayer from the
					heart, beseeching the compassionate <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName>
					to show mercy</name> to me a poor orphan wandering
					in the wilderness, that when my
					time should come, I might be prepared
					to go in peace to my eternal home.
					O! was my petition that I might
					live the life &amp; die the death of the righteous.</p>
					<p>
					Have I not just cause for considering
					this important event as my first
					conviction of sin &amp; insight into the
					precious doctrine of the atonement.
					But like the blind man in consequence
