						heard. From that time, he sought all Opportunities to hear the Gospel of our

						proved a Blessing to their hearts, which made them some time after very
						desirous to be taken into the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> and to be in a
						closer Connexion with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He therefore
						spoke with <roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>

						proved an extraordinary Blessing to him, so that his Wife and all about him
						saw a visible Change, he being so <name type="emotion">chearfull, lively and

					<p> things, he used to say: What is this to us, the Lamb will know it best; and
						again: Let us wait for our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName>
						time, his time is allways the best. Soon after this his heart secretly
						longed to partake of The  Corpse and Blood of Jesus in the <name
							event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, when  unexpectedly he was sent for,
						and told by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> that  our
							d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>; who knew his hunger would
						soon  accomplish his desire, and should therefo be confirmd and blessed,
						which made his heart very glad and more attached to the Wounds of Jesus.
							<date when-iso="1749-03-24">March the 24 1749</date>. he partook of the
							<name event="communion">holy Communion</name> for the 1<hi
							rend="superscript">st</hi> time when his Soul and Body was so afected
						and penetrated thro &amp; thro with the martyrd Corpse &amp; blood of
							<persName type="deity">Jesus</persName>, as he could not express it with
						Words. He was <name type="emotion">so happy in his heart</name> and felt
						such Blessings that he scarce knew, what he eat of drank, or how he walkd or
						workd for many days, and this sound he felt ringing in his ears perpetually:
						My flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed. And indeed it proved
						itself to him real Life, and  Meat and Drink to his Heart. When his Wife was
						concernd, that she did not partake with him of the  same Priviledge, he
						behaved very tender towards her, and comforted her, saying: Have a little
						Patience, for the Lambs time is the best.</p>
					<p> Several years ago he had got a Surfeit by heating  himself with working over
						hard, which for three years past, has at times troubled him much with a
							<name health="disease">severe Costiveness and Pain in his Bowels</name>.
							<date when-iso="1752-10-07" cert="low">About 10 weeks ago</date> he was

						<persName>Oxlee</persName> went to see him, and when he  <note
							type="catchword">loo-</note>
					</p>
					<p> looked at him, he found him so solid and grounded, and with such a
						Sinnerlike Shame, as he never be fore had observed in him, So that coming
						home he said  to his Wife: <persName ref="#mlper000562">Crispin
							Taylor</persName> ripens fast for Eternity.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1752-10-28">Oct The 28</date>. <name health="disease">He
							grew worse and could work no more</name>. But soon after was obliged to
						keep his Bed. <roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> visited him, and asked him, whether he thought
						he  should be soon well again? He answered softly (for he feard his Wife
						would hear him and be grieved at it) but yet very chearfully, and said: No,
						I shall go to my D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, and further being asked:
						Whether he should like to go home, he answered O yes, with all my heart and
						Soul; I would go this night, if it pleased him, but yet I&apos;ll wait till
						he calls me, for his time is the  best. <roleName en="brother">B<hi

						exceeding glad and spoke of it with great Joy. Some days after <roleName

						<persName>Oxlee</persName> came to see him again, and found him asleep, and
						as he had had no Sleep for many nights, because of his <name
							health="disease">extreme pain</name>, he would not have him disturbd.
						But after he got wake his wife told him of it. O sayd he: Why didnt you  
						wake me, for I love the <orgName>Brethren</orgName>
						<add place="above">with my whole heart</add> and am very glad of their
						Visits, especially him, who lives so near me, and I am allways better after
						I have Seen any of them. <date when-iso="1752-11-12">Nov: the 12</date>
						<roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> visited  him again; and being asked to pray for
						him, he  asked <persName ref="#mlper000562">Crispin</persName>, what his
						heart desired most, at which he looked up, smiled and sayd: my hearts  <name
							type="emotion">Desire is, to be with my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
