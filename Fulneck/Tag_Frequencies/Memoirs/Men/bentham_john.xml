					<p> The Life of the mar&apos;d <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000548">John Bentham</persName> who was called Home the
							<date type="death" when-iso="1772-08-09">9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							August 1772.</date>
					</p>
					<p> He has dictated the following concerning himself. </p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Black Hay</placeName> in <placeName>Pudsey
							Township</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1713">1713</date> &amp; <name event="baptism"
							>baptised</name> in the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of
							England</orgName> My Mother being poor &amp; not able to care for me I
						was put out <add place="above">by the family</add> as a <roleName
							type="apprentice">Towns apprentice</roleName> to a <orgName
							religion="Presbyterian">Presbiterian</orgName>. I had no Mind to go on
						Sundays with any Master to his place of Worship, &amp; having no Concern on
						my Mind about my Salvation I went no where. My Master observing this told me
						I should be lost if I continued in the way I then was, &amp; should go to a
						place of Torment when I died. This had the Effect upon me that I went to
							<placeName>Church</placeName> &amp; then I thought my Case was safe, but
						even this proved the Occasion to hurtful Entanglements, &amp; also to my
							<name event="marriage">marrying</name> unhappily which was attended with
						many painful Consequences. By this Marriage I had 2 Daughters. When
							<persName ref="#mlper000536">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
							Ingham</persName> began to preach in these parts I want to hear him,
						&amp; the Word had some Effect upon me for some Time, but alas, I soon got
						into my old wretched Course again. Being one Sunday at <placeName>Tong
							Church</placeName> I was asked by the late <roleName type="honorific"
								>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Jonathan Heartly</persName> to go with him to hear the
							<orgName>Brethren</orgName> at <placeName>Bankhouse</placeName>; at
						first I told him I would not, but he however prevailed upon so to do, &amp;
						I have abundant Reason to thank my dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that He inclined me to go. What
						I there heard of the Love of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<name type="emotion">melted my heart</name> &amp; had the Effect upon me
						that I returned home in a very different Mind to what I had before, being
						now determined to seek in earnest after the Salvation of my Soul, nor could
						I afterwards have Rest or Satisfaction till I found Mercy &amp; peace in
							<persName type="deity">Jesus Christ</persName>. Soon after this I was
							<name event="reception">rec&apos;d</name> into the
							<orgName>Society</orgName>, &amp; <date when-iso="1758-03-25">March
								25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1758</date> I was <name

								>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp; the <date when-iso="1758">same Year</date>
						was admitted to the <name event="communion">holy Communion</name> &amp;
						spent my Time in a <name type="emotion">truly happy Manner</name> in sweet
						Fellowship with my kind <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> &amp;
							<roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName>. This was a most </p>

					<p> blessed Season to my poor Heart, &amp; happy would it have been for me if I
						had remained in this Connexion with my <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> but turning aside from Him
						&amp; not proving this Grace nightly I gave Opportunity to the Enemy to
						blind my Eyes again, to lay hold of me as his Captive &amp; to lead me
						according to his Will, &amp; thus was brought into most shameful &amp;
						scandalous Things to the unspeakable Grief of the whole <orgName
							en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp;
						still more to the Grief &amp; Reproach of my merciful <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, &amp;
						which was oftenwards attended <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>
						with much Loss, Distress &amp; <name type="emotion">Anguish to my own
							Soul</name> as no one but myself can have a true Conception of. I
						brought myself into Hell Torment indeed for I forfeited my place &amp;
						privileges in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName>, &amp; lost all Sight &amp; feeling of my
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						&amp; my Sins lay so heavy upon me that I knew no possible way of living in
						this Condition, All which Misery was occasioned by the well known
						Circumstances of my <name event="marriage">second Marriage</name>. I &amp;
						my wife being both guilty &amp; <name type="emotion">also both miserable
							&amp; unhappy beyond Description</name> we knew not what to do but to
						weep &amp; cry to <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> that if possible
						He might look on us in our deplorable Condition &amp; shew Mercy unto us. He
						was also entreated of us &amp; had Mercy upon such abominable Sinners as we
						were, that we could believe &amp; feel that He had pardoned our many &amp;
						heinous Transgressions. We then prayed the whole <orgName en="congregation"
								>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> to forgive us &amp;
							<name event="reception">receive</name> us once more into her Fellowship
						&amp; which in Time was granted unto us to our abiding Consolation. This was
						a Grace which I shall thank my sweet <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> for throughout my whole Life
						&amp; also in Eternity. From this Time I have been enabled to live under a
						bowing Sense of my sweet <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love, &amp; the Blessings I
						have enjoyed in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName> have been highly prized by me; yea every the least </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> Crumb I enjoyed I rec&apos;d out of Mercy as a Favour I was undeserving of.
						I shall never be able to thank Him duly for what He has done for me poor
						unfaithful Sinner, but shall etarnally sing of his Love &amp; Mercy &amp;
						Faithfullness. So far out of his Account. Since his Readmission to the
							<orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>
						he has spent his Time as a Sinner who had received Grace, &amp; acknowledged
						himself very undeserving of what he enjoyed. Some Time ago his Constitution
						began to break &amp; he declined gradually, but was chearful in his Heart
						&amp; confident to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName> &amp; thus continued till he obtained permission
						to enter into the joy of his <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>.
