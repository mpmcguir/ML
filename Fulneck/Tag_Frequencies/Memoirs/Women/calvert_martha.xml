						meeting, where I remem ber as a very little Child being told to pray to our

					<p> granted to me <date when-iso="1759-05-21">May 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st</hi> 1759</date>. I was now very happy and comfort able, felt
						quite at home, and thought I wanted nothing more. The <date

							<persName ref="diety">Saviour</persName> that his aim might be obtained
						with me. <date when-iso="1760-01-18">Jan. 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>

								>th</hi> of Aug. the same year</date>, when <name event="sacrament"
							>I had the favour to enjoy this sacramental food for the first

						know my own depravity and sinfulness, and our <persName type="deity"
							>Saviour</persName> manifested himself to </p>
					<p> my heart in a particular manner as my <roleName type="honorific"
							>Redeemer</roleName>. I learned to know that without him I could do
						nothing, which proved a good and holesome School to me, and after this I
						went on for sometime in a <name type="emotion">happy course</name>. In my

							<date when-iso="1764">1764</date> was a very searching time in this
								<orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, which was also

					<p> favour to meet at the <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> table
						words cannot express. To say much more concerning my pilgrimage here below,
						I am not able, nor has any thing very striking accur red, my <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> has dealt <del>has</del> with me as
						a kind and tender Father, lead me on by degrees as I was able to bear it,
						and kept his faithful hand over me in many trying hours of temptation. When
						I therefore now look back how I have spent my time, my only plea is;
							&quot;<persName type="deity">God</persName> be merciful to me a
						sinner.&quot; I find abundent <name type="emotion">cause to thank and
							adore</name> my kind <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> for
						all his love and faith fulness towards me in every respect; in my imply he
						has blessed me that I have wanted for nothing and often when I was sweeping
						the Sleeproom, and being with </p>
					<p> my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> alone, I have had many
						happy hours, when I could simply lay my case before him. Now when I am not
						able to do any thing, the time will now and then apear long to me, but I
						pray to him to strenghten my faith and confidence, and to prepare me for his
						heavenly kingdom, I am <name type="emotion">very thankful</name> that I am
						able to attend the meetings, which prove a great comfort and refreshment to
						my heart. </p>

					<p>Our late <roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						did not think when she dictated this, that she still should remain so long
						in this vale of tears, her patience was often tried, but she prayed earnest
						ly to the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for help and sup port;
						as long <del>as long</del> as she was able, she faithfully attended the
							<placeName>Chaple</placeName>, where she found food and </p>

					<p> nourishment for her hungry soul and with great thankfulness for the
						blessings she now injoyed she often lamented, that she in former days had
						not made better use of those priviledges, she often said, that during her
						late affiliation she was in a close School, where our <persName
							type="dietey">Saviour</persName> by his good spirit pointed out to how
						many things, which led to deep self examina tion; and here she experienced
						now, that he who wounds, can also heal the sins with soul, and speak pardon
						and peace to the troubled mind, and thanked the <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName> with many tears, for what he had done for her. In <date
							when-iso="1815-07">July last year</date>, she was <name health="disease"
							>seized with a paralytick strook</name>, whereby she was deprived of
						nearly all the use of her limbs, this was </p>
					<p> an other hard trial, but the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> gave
						her grace to bear this and other afflictions with patience, tho&apos; she
						often longed for the time to be with him; she would frequently say, o what
						happiness awaits me, when I shall see my <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> face to face, O what endless mercy, that he will
						receive such a poor and worth sinner as I am. The <date
							when-iso="1816-03-12">12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Last.</date> she
						was according to her desire blessed for her departure and com mended to the
						friend of her soul, and the <date when-iso="1816-03-15">15<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi></date> early in the morning it pleased
						our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to call her hence, to rest
						with him for ever more. Aged 72 years. 5 Months. </p>
