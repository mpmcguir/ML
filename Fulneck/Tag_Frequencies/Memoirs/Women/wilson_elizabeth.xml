                  were afraid that something had happen'd to me, my Mother ask'd me if my mistress
                  had been hard with me. I answer'd no, it was something that I had dream'd, then my
                  Father came to me, &amp; said, come now tell me what it is, but my heart was quite
                  full, however I told it; &amp; it was, I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a man
                  came to me, drest in a white surples, stood over me, &amp; look'd very solid at

                  write with his finger upon my forehead, for a good while, then he laid his hand
                  upon my head with such a powerfull feeling that tears flow'd without number, then
                  he look'd again at me and smil'd &amp; turn'd away &amp; left me, then I tho<hi
                     rend="superscript">t</hi> I will fetch a looking glass to see what was done on
                  my forehead, but I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> if he has wrote, I cant read

               <p>indeed seem'd to me very long, but I began to think I will forget this feeling,
                  &amp; be as I was before, but I cou'd not, for it always came to me again, once I
                  went to my Father &amp; privately took their H. Book, &amp; bro<hi
                     rend="superscript">t</hi> it away with me, for I tho<hi rend="superscript"
                     >t</hi> I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> see what my Sis<hi rend="superscript"
                     >rs</hi> sung out of that book, for they often sung when I was there, &amp;
                  when my Mistress &amp; all were in Bed, I read in it, &amp; that verse: Yea wounds
                  of Jesus bless me now; that verse soon took my mind, for I began to think who is
                  that Jesus w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> has wounds, I tho<hi rend="superscript"
                     >t</hi> I know no meaning of this, however I re<add place="above">a</add>d it
                  over &amp; over &amp; the sametime tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, as soon as my
                  time is out, I will go to hear those people, that I have despis'd so much, perhaps
                  they will tell me more of that Jesus; so I did, when my time was out, I went with
                  my parents, to hear the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> to my great joy for the
                  first time, I heard them, they told of that Jesus, full of wounds w<hi
                     rend="superscript">ch</hi> was made for poor sinners, this struck me deeply
                     <note type="catchword">then</note></p>

               <p>then I was soon taken into the society, I went on &amp; felt our <roleName

                  &amp; was so happy that I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I wanted nothing more,
                  in his way I went on for near 7 Years, then I began to think of being rec<hi
                     rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp;
                  spoke about it, it happen'd that some were re<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                  <del>before one</del> out of my class, &amp; I was left, then I was griev'd &amp;
                     tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> they chose the worst, &amp; leave the best,
                  for I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> they chose the worst, &amp; have the best,
                  for I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> myself the fittest, I therefore went away
                  perplext indeed, but it did not remain long, for my dear <roleName
                     type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> soon shew'd me,
                  that I was the worst of all, &amp; my happiness was nothing; then I felt quite
                  miserable &amp; tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> it is no wonder, that I am
                  unreceived for I am not fit for the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, nor any
                  thing else, I thot I had griev'd our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi

                  forgive me, in this situation I went on for almost a week, &amp; on Sunday I went

                  those that were the most sinfull of all, &amp; said that our <roleName

                  whether he can forgive me, I therefore threw myself at the thro pierced feet of

                  forgive thee all thy sins, yes I forgive thee ev'ry thing &amp; own thee as one of
