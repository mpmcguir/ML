							I was born at Northarm in the parish of Halifax
							in the <add place="above">May 29</add> year 1722. My Parents being very religious
							endeavour&apos;d to bring me up strictly in the fear of God.
							they very early perceiving my natural turn to be quick livly
							and active, on that account took the greater care of me takeing
							me with them constantly to the Decenters meetings, as I at that
							time did not understand their meaning, I look upon it as being
							very hardly dealt with, but afterwards saw clearly that their
							intentions where only to prevent my entrance on a very loose course
							of life which I might have fall&apos;n into, had not their unwearied
							care &amp; faithfullness, been a great means of preserving me, together
							with an invisible Hand, which I often felt While very young over
							me without any knowlidge of the meaning thereof for which I
							shall forever remain thankfull, I went on much in this way
							till M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Inham came to these parts, to whose preaching the
							greatest part of the people resorting, I went among the rest, being
							thereby stir&apos;d up &amp; often brought to reflect on my state, but with
							out any lasting impression. I remember one night being very
							thoughtfull when going to bed, I dream&apos;d that I was to be put to
							death, at which I was very much perplex&apos;t, I intreated to be spar&apos;d
							while I was set to die. The earnestness I was in awoke me,
							but the impression of this I never lost, &amp; by means of the uncom
							mon feelings I had somtimes I thought surly there was some
							thing to be injoy&apos;d, to which I was as yet a stranger, but was
							not rightly satisfy&apos;d to be without it.

								<hi rend="superscript">coming</hi> the Brethern into Yorkshire with a<hi rend="strikethrough">n</hi>
							vein <hi rend="strikethrough">intention</hi> to settle societies, accordingly tookdown the names of
							those who constantly atended the preaching. I therefore was willing
							to have mine taken down, which was no sooner done, but I was
							amazingly struck, thinking I am now however fast, but did not
							repent it. I soon found it was not alone the taking down the

							names but they entended to look more particularly after each one
							therefore they soon settled Bands to which I was admitted &amp; geting
							a great love for them they were very much blest to me. Some of my
							Companions being soon after this receiv&apos;d into the Congregation it
							Cause&apos;d me many uneasy hours, as I was left, however I thought
							to try &amp; get to them though I knew not how to set about it, when almost
							dispairing I often felt exceedingly encouraged and very much strengthened
							I was not allow&apos;d to go to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> meetings this drove me to the
							determination to make my mind known which I did by a letter
							to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> expressing my greatest desire to be embody&apos;d with them.
							My request was soon granted our in year 1745 this was an inex
							pressible grace &amp; favour to me past discribing being then very
							chearfull I thought I had then got all that could make my happiness
							compleat. In this way I went on for some time.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							In the year 1747 the first Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy was settl&apos;d at Oxhaighs I
							having the favour to be one of the first, I look&apos;d on it &amp; accepted it with
							a real thankfull heart, &amp; the blessing which I then enjoy&apos;d will never
							be forgot by me. This happiness lasted for some time but before I was
							aware it all vanishd away and I was left as much distresst as ever
							being ready to determin to leave the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; take my thing in the world but my Consionec would not permit me to take such a step
							on this account I often whr&apos;d to a lonly place, which I had found
							quite to my mind, then I often lamented my state without the least
							hopes of being helpt through, &amp; sav&apos;d at last but my best &amp; faithfull
							friend notwithstanding my negligence followed me endeavouring
							to bring me to the place where I at all times bught to have a remaind
							er at his feet, he thererfore an Oppertunity to show me my state
							by nature &amp; convincd me that noself working would avail me any
							thing, but he was willing to take my care on himself. I was hereby
							quite overcome, by his asuring me I was his, which so worked on me
							that I was determin&apos;d to be his intirly with soul &amp; body, and as a poor
							Sinner to receive grace at his hand.

							My longing was now daily increased to become a partaker of the
							Holy Sacrement which grace was granted me Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1747 after
							which I believd simply I should yeild more satisfaction to the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; my self. These thoughts brought me into a very loyal
							way but could not with my best endeavours effect what I wish for,
							and having no Laboress at that time to help &amp; encourage us,
							I thought to direct myself, but not being able this way only brought
							me into confusion. At last I was convinc&apos;d that even those who were
							partakers of his body &amp; blood could lay up no store without a
							daily &amp; hourly supply from the fountain from whence all good
							springs. Therefore I determin&apos;d to be directed and Influenced
							alone by him who has often approv&apos;d himself as my friend in need.
							In the year 1748 I mov&apos;d to home Oeconomy where I liv&apos;d a year
							Chearfully &amp; satisfy&apos;d then there being a new Oeconomy began
							at Littlemoore. I was one that was place&apos;d there where I learnd
							to know more of myself and the leading of our Saviour with me
							then I was sensible of before. In the year 50 I mov&apos;d again
							to the Oeconomy at Conhouse, where I thought to live Chearfully
							with the rest of my Companions. But here I must observe
							I was again disturb&apos;d by my own Corruption of which I thought
							I had sufficient Knowledge <add place="above">before</add> but found the depth of my natural
							Corrupted heart was unfathomable which made me almost
							conclude it was unpossible for me to be help to the end of days
							I was often encouraged by those about me to
							believe I was not to bad for our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but to no purpose, till I
							felt it scals &amp; made clear to my heart by my best friend. He
							often took such oppertunities as these to melt &amp; bow my heart before
							him anew, &amp; thereby to make my call &amp; diction of grace of greater
							value to me. The same year the Oeconomy mov&apos;d to fulneck
							there to reside till the Choir house which was their building,

							was finish&apos;d, into which as soon as it was ready, I mov&apos;d with
							the first company, at the entrance of which I again renew&apos;d
							my Covenant with my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and partook of the grace
							which in a particular manner prevail&apos;d at that time.
							here as well as in all other places &amp; during my whole life
							<add place="above">notwithstanding</add>
								<hi rend="strikethrough">during</hi> all failings wants &amp; defects I was alway follow&apos;d
							and often comforted by him who has alway approv&apos;d himself
							as my only effectual Comforter &amp; Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. So he will Continue
							to me to the end of my days. he has often been so visibly near
							my heart as if I had seen him with my bodily eyes, yea I could
							Converse with him as with an intimate friend about every
							thing. In the year 1760 I had a Call to go to Bedford, as
							it was thought best I went out of Obedience at which place
							I was receiv&apos;d with so much love &amp; heartiness as I can&apos;t express
							but <add place="above">and</add> I <add place="above">have often</add> reflected on it with thankfullness, So far Her own 
							words
							but meeting with difficulties of various sorts, the employment
							for which I went there not answering the wish for end,
							and having a great desire to return to fulneck, as my
							Bodily Health was also much impair&apos;d I made my desire
							Known, which after Consideration was consented too &amp; I returnd
