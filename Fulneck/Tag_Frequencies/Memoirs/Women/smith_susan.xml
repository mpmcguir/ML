               <p>if we loved our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> which made a days
                  impression on my heart. I my <date when-iso="1761" cert="medium">15<hi

                     house</placeName> here, I entered with thankfulness, as I felt myself very
                  unworthy of such a privile<del>d</del>ge, I found myself soon at home, lived for
                  sometime very <name type="emotion">happy</name>, and with the meetings I was
                  greatly <name type="emotion">delighted</name>. In externals it was difficult,
                  nothing but spinning, however as long as I was satisfied, I did well; but when I
                  deviated from the right path I grew <name type="emotion">unhappy and
                     discontended</name>, this brought me into trouble and dark- ness, reasoning and
                  dispare, I wish'd to injoy privile<del>d</del>ges in the Congn but had to wait 7
                  years before I was recd Still my <roleName type="honorifc">Saviour</roleName> had
                  thoughts of peace over me, and gave me grace to reflect on the past time, I felt
                  and found that I had not been attentive to the </p>
               <p> voice of his holy Spirit, nor put my trust and confidence in him, this brought me
                  into deep concern, I wept and prayed many nights and days that our <roleName
                     type="honorifi">Saviour</roleName> would pardon my sins and transgressions, and
                  receive me anew as his property, and I thank him this day, for his pardon, mercy
                  and comfort which he then imparted to me. <date when-iso="1768-11-13">Nov. 13th
                     1768</date> I was <name type="event" subtype="reception">recd into the

                  proved days of solid belssings to me, and I felt again <name type="emotion"

                     >Saviours</roleName> nearness and the priviliges of the Congn proved a great
                  refreshment and incouragement to my poor and needy soul. But alas! I soon again
                  came into a dark and reasoning way, on which account I had many heavy hours, my

               <p>was very great, I went to the H Comn often when I felt and knew it would have been
                  better for me not to partake of this heavenly repast. Often I thought I would run
                  away where I might be seen no more, and once I did set off and went to
                     <placeName>Mortenbank</placeName> to a Relation, but feeling no rest there
                  neither, I returned back again. I shall never forget the kindness then shown to
                  me, of which I was so undeserving, but above all the mercy, love and forbearance
                  of my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, who still had not forsaken
                  me; but kept his hand over me his erring Sheep. I stayed now from the H Comn for
                  several times, the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> had much to do for
                  me, he pardoned my sins and washed them away in his precious Blood, and the <date

                  an injoyment which I never shall forget. Now when I reflect on my ihequered
                  course, I find thousand reasons to fall down at my <persName type="dietey"
                     >Saviours</persName> feet, to thank and praise him for his unwearied
                  faithfulness his patience and longsuffering, and tho I have often grieved him and
                  disobeed the voice of his holy spirit; <hi rend="superscript">still</hi> he sought
                  and found me when I strayed from him, and received me with open arms of mercy. "O
