							Mary Alott
							Was born at Barksland in the Parish of
							Elland. On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Decr 1734 N S.
						</p>
					<p>
							When she was about Three years old her
							Father dyed &amp; she liv&apos;d with her Mother &amp;
							her Aunt (Namely Betty Midgley) who
							jointly Nurs&apos;d &amp; Maintain&apos;d <add place="above">her</add> till she was
							about seven, then her Mother being again
							Married her Aunt left them took a Room
							&amp; design&apos;d to live by herself, But <add place="above">Mary</add> not being
							at all willing to be left behind often begg&apos;d 
							her Aunt to take her with her, which 
							according<add place="above">ly</add> in a few weeks after she Willlingly
							did, &amp; Cared for her as her own.
						</p>
					<p>
							When she was about Nine years old she
							by the Drawing of the Holy Ghost was inclin&apos;d
							to hear the Gospel which she of her own free
							accord begun &amp; Continued Constantly to do. 
						</p>
					<p>
							Some time after her Aunt had a mind for
							the more Convenince of hearing the Brn
							to live nearer Smith House &amp; she made it
							out with the Brethren that Mary should also
							come &amp; remain with her which she was very 
							glad off.
						</p>
					<p>
							In July 1748 they Both of them together got
							leave to live with the Single Sisters in Clack-
							Heaton &amp; she remain&apos;d there &amp; in the same
							Oconomy at Tyre-sell-Hall till we came
							in the Choir House (Which I shall take
							Notice of afterwards)
						</p>
					<p>
							In the year 1751 on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April she
							was receiv&apos;d in the Congregation which Pleas&apos;d

							her very much. In 1753 on the 25 of February
							she after many a Hearty wish &amp; Earnest longing
							for it was addmitted to the Lords Supper
							In the same year was Receiv&apos;d from the Great Girls
							to the Single Sisters Choir.
						</p>
					<p>
							She has since about 10, or 11, Years Old,
							carried about a Very Sickly &amp; Weakly Tabernacle
							which she bore without Complaint, &amp; being of an 
							exceeding shill quiet, but also very solid &amp;
							sensible <del>Dispossition</del> she was seldom
							heard to speak about any thing except when
							spoken to: But however as we now have found she
							took good Notice of ever thing &amp; Ponderd them in 
							her Heart.
						</p>
					<p>
							In February this present year she had the
							Small-Pox which not only went very hardly
							with her But also left that remaining on her
							which Render&apos;d her Much more Weak &amp; Sickly
							than before a Consumption appearing thro&apos; her
							Whole Constitution: It was manifest to all about her
							she could not hold it out long, tho she herself wod
							commonly say when ask&apos;d about it &quot;that she was
							pretty well Nevertheless what she inwardly felt
							Brought her <add place="above">also</add> upon the thoughts &amp; consideration 
							of going to Our Saviour (as she afterward, de
							clar&apos;d with Joy.)
						</p>
					<p>
							In July she was a little Better but the disor
							der Presently return&apos;d more strong than ever:
							Yet she continued to walk about till the 22d of
							November, then she entirely took her to her
							Room &amp; soon after to her Bed.
						</p>
					<p>
							Now she freely acknowledgeing that she
							had all this summer last, been in a Continual
							meditation &amp; Consultation with her Dear Saviour
							<note type="catchword">about</note>
						
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						
							about her going to him, having <add place="above">all</add> along been Senscible
							of it for herself that she should not stay here
							but the Reason why she would not confess it
							openly was because she was affraid she should
							not go as soon as she wish&apos;d for.
						</p>
					<p>
							She was now exceeding Bad, but quite Brisk
							in <add place="above">her</add> Spirits &amp; chearful in Heart &amp; Soul, &amp; as before
							even Ever since we have known her she has
							been us&apos;d to speak very little, so Now to the Con
							trary, <add place="above">she</add> spoke a great deal especialy to these
							with whom she had had an intimiate acquaintance
							&amp; Perticularly with Our dear Sister Mary
							who very faithfully visited her all the time
						</p>
					<p>
							On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant she had her Birth-Day
							(being 20; years old,) when many Sisters who vis
							ited her Express&apos;d their Hearty wishes for her
							which she receiv&apos;d, &amp; answer&apos;d with much satis
							faction: In the afternoon her Class made
							her a Very Pretty Love-Feast which rejoice
							ed her Exceedingly &amp; in which she spoke of
							her Departure with such Pleasure &amp; Delight
							as she never had done before; she spoke with
							sister Mary &amp; Made out Ev&apos;ry thing that was in 
							her Mind about her Burial, as well as all
							the Hearty wishes &amp; desires of her heart for
							her Class &amp; c. In short she said that this had
							been to her the Happiest day she ever had
							had in all her life. This day &amp; forward she 
							unbosom&apos;d &amp; declar&apos;d what she had (Perhaps)
							kept Treasur&apos;d up in her Heart to this Opper
							tunity for some years Past, She spoke of her 
							various Troubles &amp; Anxieties in Particular Circum
							<note type="catchword">-stances</note>

							Circumstances, such as no body had perciev&apos;d on her
							with a Chearful &amp; Thankful Heart, being
							bowed with Shame before him will whom she
							had spent many happy Moments, days &amp; years
						</p>
					<p>
							About the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it being Two years since
							we came in <add place="above">our</add> Choir House she told Sister Mary
							Ev&apos;rything how she had been &amp; was in Tyre-
							sell-Hall at that time, What Anxiety &amp;
							Concern she felt about coming in the Choir House
							fearing Least she should not have leave to 
							come &amp; how she had in Shillness Pray&apos;d &amp; wept
							before her dear Lamb, that he would give
							her Leave to come &amp; that if she should have 
							that favour that he would grant her the feel
							ing &amp; nearness of his Wounds that she might
							be faithful to him therein &amp;c. Nay his almost
							incredible, how quick &amp; active her Memory
							was over this matter she not only gave Sisr
							Mary an account of herself but of all the 
							Sisters in Tyre-sell-Hall at that time, she 
							(unperceiv&apos;d) had taken Notice of ev&apos;ry One,
							conduct words &amp; behaviour, But to return
							she also Express&apos;d herself in a very Lively
							manner with grace &amp; Understanding <hi rend="underline">how</hi>
							Exceedingly she was Rejoiced when she was
							assured she should come here. She at the 
							same time viz&apos; the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Instant spoke w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							with an inly Tender feeling about the Choir
							&amp; Choir Grace what she has felt since
							she was Receiv&apos;d in the Single Sisters Choir
							&amp; what her dear Bridegroom has done from
							time to time on her therein, &amp; Perticularly
							in this Present Year, together with the Esteem
							<note type="&amp;" />
						
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						
							&amp; Satisfaction she has had for, &amp; in the Choir House
							this she did from time to time Repeat And
							also she would allways take notice of many
							Sisters whom she saw &amp; Reflected on their
							Situation at Present and time Pass &amp; when
							Sister Mary came to her then she would sell
							her all her Mind about them &amp; Especialy the
							concern she had had, about her Class under
							some heavy Circumstances some Months agoe
							&amp; being ask&apos;d why she did not speak at such
							time what she had in her mind? She answer&apos;d
							&quot;that she always thought herself too mean
							&amp; too insignificant to Speak Her mind about
							any thing, But she had instead of that gone
							somewhere in a Corner &amp; Wept for them be
							fore her dear Saviour &amp; Pray&apos;d him that he
							would Bless Preserve &amp; keep them &amp; Her
							&amp; that they Might all become a Joy to Him
						</p>
					<p>
							Once in Sister Mary&apos;s Presence after having
							fully spoken &amp; Open&apos;d all her Mind to her a
							bout Many things, she took Notice that her
							Aunt (who faithfuly tended &amp; Nurs&apos;d
							her all the time of Sickness) was a Cry
							ing: So she demanded the Reason of her why
							she wept, telling her she had no Ocassion
							to weep for her since &quot;says she&quot; I am fully
							Satisfied &amp; Reconciled both with My Lamb &amp;
							&amp; with all my Sisters &amp; have spoke my mind 
							about Everything &amp; Now am Ready to go 
							whenever he Pleases
						</p>
					<p>
							Thus she Continued under a Deep Sense
							&amp; Speaking of herself &amp; her Choir &amp; Often
							Expressing her Desire to go. But yet she

							would Secretly sometimes say to her Aunt that
							she believ&apos;d she should live till Christmas, but
							If our Saviour Pleasd to take her before, she
							would be glad
						</p>
					<p>
							Sunday Last about 11 or 12 in the Evening
							she was Siez&apos;d with the monst Violent pain
							So that Sister Mary who at the same time
							watch&apos;d with her Perceiv&apos;d such a Senscible
							Alteration not only by her Excessive Pains
							but also by the Motion &amp; Alteration of all
							her Faculties that she thought she Realy would 
							go, &amp; thereupon ask&apos;d her if she was now quite
							Ready. She with Pleasure &amp; Serenity answerd
							&quot;yes! I am Quite Ready now &amp; shall be glad to
							go to my Lamb as soon as he Pleases&quot;
						</p>
					<p>
							However she reviv&apos;d a little &amp; then desired
							2 verses which she named to be sung for her
							viz Appear as her Protector who turns to
							Joy all Tears &amp; When she shall get Per
							mission to leave this Mortal Tent, From Pains
							&amp; Griefs Dissmission Thy self Just then present
							And then says she &quot;Sing Hush stir not up
							the friend of Christ, Wake not the lovely
							Bride &amp;c
						</p>
					<p>
							She was very Bad all Night &amp; Lay like
							one Expireing till towards Night on Monday
							Yet she Bore her Pains with Much more
							Patience <add place="above">than</add> any one could Expect who did but
							<hi rend="underline">see</hi> how she was Munday night she was some
							waht Easier &amp; appear&apos;d to ys as if she might
							Possibly continue a few days, But if she heard
							any one take notice of the near approach 
							<note type="catchword">of</note>

					<p>
						
							of
							Christmass &amp; of the Joy we Expected in the Birth
							day of our Saviour She would readly answer
							them that if our Saviour only was Pleas&apos;d to let
							her go to him before or in the Holidays She
							should have a far Better Christmass than 
							We and that she would be glad of.
						</p>
					<p>
							Tusday Night she Alter&apos;d again &amp; on Wed
							nesday Morning was much Worse. In the
							Forenoon we thought again she would Certain
							ly Depart, But she continued and lay severly
							Oppresse&apos;d with the Most Excessive Pangs thro&apos;
							Ev&apos;ry Limb &amp; Fibre, Speaking very little, But
							Panting in Stillness for the Happy Moment
							when she should get the Departing Kiss, And 
							when Sometimes her Tabernacle seem&apos;d to be
							almost Rack&apos;d in Pieces with the most shock
							ing &amp; Excessive Pain as almost could be thought
							Unpossibl a Human Creature could Bear. she 
							would say &quot;Ah! how 
							shall I hold it Out Why does he not fetch me
							Sis Mary then would remind her of the Hard
							Toil &amp; Conflict of our Saviour which he bore
							in his Humanity Saying My dear Heart it
							is but a few Minutes &amp; you will be with 
							him, She that Moment was again in a 
							Calm Serenity<add place="above">Heavenly</add> &amp; Peace <add place="above">&amp;</add> Said O! yes he soon
							will fetch me to his Embraces, Which she
							Obtain&apos;d Under these Words, The Lamb w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>

							so she sweetly went to sleep in the Arms of 
							her Lover about 5 o&apos;clock in the Evening

					<p>
							It is to be Oberv&apos;d that this dear Heart

							Receiv&apos;d in the Congregation The Only One

							Constancy in her Love to him who first gave
