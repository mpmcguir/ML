					<p> trouble of mind, not willing to follow the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, and <name type="emotion">full of fear</name> to be lost
						eternally; during this period, which was in her <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">16<hi rend="superscript"
							>th</hi> year</date>, she had a very remarkable dream: it was to her as if she
						saw our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> on the Cross, in the most lovely attitude, saying to her,
						&quot;all my sufferings, wounds and bruises were for thee, to save and
						redeem thy sinful soul.&quot; This made a deep impression on her mind, and
						she turned in earnest prayer to the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, that he would pardon her sins and
						transgressions and renew a right spirit within her, &amp; once when walking
						in a field by herself, with <name type="emotion">tears and prayer lifting up her hands to him</name>,
						she got an assurance that her guilt should be done away, and that he would
						prove her good Shepherd <note type="catchword">who</note>

					<p> She now felt a desire to be closer united with the <orgName en="congregation">Brns Cong<hi

					<p> the meetings as she used to do, which was a great trial to her.</p>
					<p> She was however able to go about in the house, tho&apos; at last with great
						difficulty, till the <date when-iso="1815-11-06">6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month</date>, when she

						worthless sinner, in mercy, "and I am sure he will.&quot; </p>
					<p> On the <date when-iso="1815-11-13">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> she called to mind the blessings she
						had often enjoyed on that great memorial day, and particularly what she had

							<l>O ye, who don&apos;t stand well with him,</l>

						</lg> Now, now, is for you the right time Come all without exception. She
						spent the following days mostly in a slumber, and when she awoke between,
