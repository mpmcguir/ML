					<p> I was born in <placeName>holbeck</placeName> in the <placeName>parish of

							>Lord</roleName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1717-05-18">1717 May ye 18</date> of very dear
						&amp; tender parrents who were prebytouryons but I was <name event="baptism"
							>baptiz&apos;d</name> by a Minister of the <orgName religion="Anglican"
							>Church of England</orgName> on account of their thinking of my soon
						departing this life Else I was educated in the Religion of the <orgName
							religion="Presbyterian">presbytierens</orgName> When I was a little
						Child and my mother Dressing of me She generaly told me I was now going
						amongst other Children to play, and I should perhaps hear them say bad words
						and Charg&apos;d me to take care I did not so, for it was a bad thing and
						this had such an Impression on my mind that It never left me, no not when I
						was amongst the Children, but always remain&apos;d in my mind that it was
						such a bad thing to do so <date when-iso="1724" cert="medium">from 7 years
							old</date> I often went into a Corner to pray, that <persName
							type="deity">god</persName> would have Mercy on me and <name
							type="emotion">often wept before him</name>, when I had the <name
							health="disease">Smallpox</name> it was thought by every one who Saw me
						that I should have gone home, then <date when-iso="1724" cert="medium">being
							but 7 years old</date>, but my mother on her knees often pray&apos;d the
							<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> to Spare my Life howsoever I
						might be disfigur&apos;d with them I used to ask my mother what one might do
						to be Saved, and she told me I must pray to the <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName> and beleive on him and I should be Saved and I asked
						her if one could not be sure she said no she beleiv&apos;d not, but one must
						pray to him and beleive in him in my young years I came into Several dangers
						of my Life Especially once when I was drawing water at a deep Well, the
						Roulor which winds up the Rope came out of the frame, and it with the Swape
						went all into the well and pulled me on to my knees after it I Liv&apos;d
						Still with my parrents in a private manner kept no Company and at nights
						when work was done I used to go into the feilds and pray that ye <roleName
							type="honorific">Lord</roleName> would have Mercy on me, I often
						Sigh&apos;d &amp; thought O that I was sure of my Salvation till <date
							when-iso="1731" cert="medium">I was about fourteen years of age</date>
						Some neighbour Girls about that time was throng in gotting fine Cloaths I

					<p> with great eagerness I tought now I will have some pleasure of my Life
						Living a Religious Life &amp; takeing care as much as possible to avoid
						every thing that was bad thinking I might by that means injoy <name
							type="emotion">some pleasure</name> of my Life and go to <placeName
							type="religious">heaven</placeName> as others did <date
							notAfter="1733-05-18" cert="medium">before I was sixteen years of
							age</date> I met with a young man who told me, he had pitch&apos;d on me
						for his wife, I told him I was too young, he told me he would wait till I
						was older I found my self thereby drawn in to something, which when my dear
						&amp; tender parrents as well as my Sister <add place="above">heaped of
						</add>they did all in their power to brake it off out of tender love to me
						this <name type="emotion">greiv&apos;d &amp; troubld</name> me very much for
						some years I could not got it out of my mind, nor could I take any pleasure
						in any thing as before I had many good offers but being disapointed once it
						set me quite against it when I had gone now some years in this disatisfied
						Condition I heard that <persName ref="#mlper000536">Mr Ingham</persName> was
						going about to preach the Gospel, I went to hear him, and he preach&apos;d
						concerning the forgiveness of sins which was so much to me that it directly
						eas&apos;d me of all my former trouble &amp; uneasiness I came home weeping
						all the way for 3 mile which I had never gone before nor did I know the way
						till then my Dear parrents were much affected seeing me in such a weeping
						Condidition I pray&apos;d our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>
						to give me my parrents and the whole Family, which he did directly, I went
						to the meetings and often wept after the forgiveness of my sins &amp; the
						full assurance of it in my heart it was often to me in the midst of my
						prayers as if the Person above mention&apos;d stood before me &amp; I was
						praying to him this troubl&apos;d me very much I strove &amp; pray&apos;d
						with weeping to get him out of my mind at Last I turn&apos;d to our
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> &amp; with great Egarness
						&amp; said to him <persName type="deity">Lord Jesus</persName> thou canst
						help me take this away from me which hinders me from seeking thy rich
						forgiveness for the sake of which I wou&apos;d part with every thing else I
						found he did help me and took it quite away where upon I thought he can do
						all things for me being Sure I could no </p>

					<p> by no <add place="above">other</add> means have got rid of them I
						pray&apos;d heartily to him, for the full asurance of the forgiveness of all
						my sins, which I could no Longer be satisfied about, at the same time hardly
						knowing what I wanted forgiving, but at once it came into my mind, that I
						had never Lov&apos;d <persName type="deity">God</persName> in my Life from
						thence flow&apos;d all my sins which I ever had done or said, then I went on
						mourning night &amp; day thinking I must be Lost, &amp; wishing myself any
						sort of creature but what I was, I work&apos;d at the same time among a
						company of 8 or 10 very wicked people in a shop, who spent their time in
						Singing songs or Swearing the day long, while I sat <name type="emotion"
							>weeping &amp; praying</name> they thinking that I to be sure was going
						of my Senses, at that time in the midst of all this company, it was to me as
						if I saw our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> Cover&apos;d all
						over with Blood &amp; wounds, standing before me who told me that he had
						dy&apos;d for me &amp; received all those wounds in his Sacred Body on my
						account, <name type="emotion">my heart was filld with rapture</name> &amp; I
						wish&apos;d that the whole world coul&apos;d Join with me, to praise him I
						went a qarter of year without ever losing this impression, and feeling I
						then got, after this I begun to <name type="emotion">feel my self very poor,
							and left that feeling of Joy</name> which I had, this Causd me to mourn,
						&amp; think what I had grow&apos;d my dear <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName> with about this time dear <persName><roleName
								type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
							Bohler</persName> came into those parts who preach&apos;d our dear
						Saviours death &amp; wounds more clear then ever I had heard before, by this
						I learn&apos;d to know that I should remain poor and Low in my self, &amp;
						go to him in his wounds &amp; Blood Just as I was, then I begaun to reason
						over myself that I had not known his wounds &amp; blood aright, &amp; could
						not be satisfied about till I had Learn&apos;d to know them better so I wept
						and pray&apos;d so long before him till he again satisfied my poor heart,
						&amp; afresh let me feel the power of his wounds and Blood here upon I
						ask&apos;d my dear parrents to forgive me every thing where with I had
						grow&apos;d them &amp; thank&apos;d them at the same time for Learning me to
						read which struck them very much but I was glad to read the scriptures which
						were a very great comfort to me, &amp; the dear <roleName type="honorific"
							>Holy ghost</roleName> pointed out to me thro them How I should go on,
						When I heard of the Brns Settling in <placeName ref="mlpla000084"

					<p> my heart was very much rejoiced <roleName type="honorific">B<hi

						<persName>Dicky Uttly</persName> spoke to me about writing to the
							<orgName>Congregation</orgName> for reception but I thought my self too

						wou&apos;d write to the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> in his name which I
						accordingly did and was re&apos;d on <date when-iso="12-25">Christmas

						wherever I went of I was as if the spirit of the
							<orgName>Congregation</orgName> rested upon me, and I went on happilly
						till the next communion day, when I <add place="above">was</add> admitted
						Candidate, what I then felt I shall never forgot, tho it is beyond
