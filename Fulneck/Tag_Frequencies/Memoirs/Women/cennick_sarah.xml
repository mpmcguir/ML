						The Life of the <roleName type="honorific">S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> <persName ref="#mlper000227">Sarah Cennick</persName> who went happily home <date type="birth" when-iso="1770-01-24">Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770</date>
							I was born <date type="birth" calendar="Julian">June the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> old Style 1712</date> in Reading Berks. 
							wass <name event="baptism">baptiz&apos;d</name> in the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> and brought up in that Comunion.
							The first thing I remember is the simple and happy intercourse I 
							lived in with the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>: I Knew he lov&apos;d me; and I lov &apos;d him; &amp; therefore
							used to have recourse to Him without the least reserve.
							When I was about 5 Years old, I remember to have been particularly
							naughty &amp; selfwilld, which caused me much heaviness, tho&apos; I strove all
							I could to divert and get rid of the Conviction by play &amp;c. But
							running hastily into my Mothers room, where she was sitting with
							my late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John then an Infant lying in her lap
							I saw her weeping with litted up hands, and heard her pray. I was
							much affected: But felt so hard, to acknowledge my fault, but
							upon repeatedly asking my Mother, why she cried and what she
							was saying? She referr&apos;d the Cause to me and said: &quot;I was praying
							for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> and for your Brother.&quot; This pierc&apos;d me through, and I
							thought my heart would break. For I thought, The Lord also is
							greived! I therefore silently withdrew condemn&apos;d and asham&apos;d
							and hasted to a private Place, where with many Tears, I beged
							Him to forgive me; which he most graciously did directly, and
							all my Burthen instantly removed.
						</p>
					<p>
							My Father and his Relations being all Quakers of the
							most primitive sort, and my Mother and hers all strict Church
							of England; Her attachment to, and chief acquaintance were the
							Clergy; So that I had the Oppertunity of an intimate familiarity
							with <add place="above">each</add>, not perceiving, at this time, the least disunion on either Side.
						</p>
					<p>
							Our Parish Vicar and his Family was a part of our
							most intimate acquaintance, and his Daughter, who had taken
							a liking to me from my Infancy, calling me her own Child,
							at last prevailed with my Parents, to take me more particularly
							home to her; But our houses Joining each other, I was nearly
							as much with my Parents as I was with them. This lady,
							taking me, to a friends house with her, I slip&apos;d out from
							the Company, and saw two small Boats fastened to the
							Landing Place in a deep Moat, I got into one of them
							and reached out of it to the Side of the other Boat.
							when both parting, and swiming from each other
							had dragged me out of that I stood in, had not the toes
							of my shoes hitch&apos;d in something, and prevented it.
							Thus hanging over the Water between both, I had
							scarce time to give my self up for lost, Before I Slip&apos;d
							my hold and pitched into the Water, where to my Joyfull
							surprise, instead of Sinking I found, as it were, Hands

					<p>
						
							bearing so strong against my hands as to get and keep my head above
							water. Yea those kind Assistants bore me up so long, even till I was
							capable of taking hold with one Hand of that Boat, wherein, all 
							while my shoes had hitch&apos;d, but how I recover&apos;d wholly, I never
							could remember, only that, as I came to my self, I was flat on
							my Back, safe and well. I know, who those ministers were, of
							whose kinder Orders they Obey&apos;d, and thanked them, and Him,
							Friend: beging Him 100 times over: O pray don&apos;t let it be found
							out &amp;c. Which, however remarkable, never was.
						</p>
					<p>
							I was this Gentlemans* <add place="margin">The parish vicar</add> fond Companion also, and often
							<note>In the memoir, the phrase "the parish vicar" is written in pencil in a different hand</note>
							Slid unobserv&apos;d to him, when he was retir&apos;d to private Devotion
							sometimes I kneel&apos;d behind, and at other times close by his side,
							that I might be a partaker of those influences, which I beleiv&apos;d,
							he enjoy&apos;d.
						</p>
					<p>
							As I Grew older, I had more liberty among the Servants,
							who endeavour&apos;d to seduce me and bring me into all manner of
							Wickedness, as much as they could, But finding me frighten&apos;d,
							and fearing I should tell, they threaten&apos;d me hard, what they
							would do to me, if I did. This brought me more particularly to my
							own Hearts Friend, and they let me alone for sometime; till one
							evening, I went into a back Garden, where a Company of them wo
							got, but I did not know nor think of them, till I was almost
							shock&apos;d to death, and could scarce stagger into <add place="above">the House</add>
								<hi rend="strikethrough">door</hi>, when, even in
							the very Passage, the Lord met me, Comforted me, and gave me
							the Assurance in my Heart, &quot;He would preserve me for himself
							for ever.&quot; This Promise has always been a secret Comfort to me,
							all my Course through, yea even, when in the highest of my Folly
							in the World. I was near 8 years old, &amp; made a memorandum of that
							important Day. I was kept more close to my learning, and was
							instructed in all the Principles of the Church. I also got Courage
							to discover those notorious deceivers, without their knowing it was me
							Yet my Heart departed from its dearest Object, and I became as
							Formal and vain as any Body; I saw myself a fair Candidate
							for the World; but also, Ruin, Destruction, and eternal death
							stood as fair before me. This made me go on heavily, but I could
							tell no one: And as I was under Preparation for the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							I was the more distress&apos;d; Sometimes in dispair and sometimes
							desperate. In this Situation I went to Evening Prayers, but I
							could neither pray, nor desire. I was so condemn&apos;d; But in the
							Begining of the last Prayers, my Heart became as melting Wax,
							and as such a Wretch I turn&apos;d again to my Friend, and begg&apos;d for mercy 
							and got Confidence to trust and rely on him. I had sometime before
							privately made it out in my own mind, that, as Oppertunity should
							serve, I would privately retire to a Cloister, and in that especiall
							manner dedicate myself to the Lord Forever.

							In my 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year it was thought proper by my Friends, that I should
							go to London for further Improvement. I was receiv&apos;d with the
							greatest heartiness, and every one was kindly officious in bringing 
							me to public Places, and shewing me the Curiosities of the Town. I
							saw the Glory&apos;s of the Worlds - and loved it - and concluded, as I had
							often been told, I was made for the World, for it suited my Inclination
							and tast every way; And I had well nigh set through all Convictions,
							Though at the Bottom I had a Condemn&apos;d heart and guilty Conscience.
							My Mother being in London at this time took me with her, to see a
							Friend of hers in Bedlam, and surveying the many Shocking objects
							there, she tumed to me and said. &quot;This is the <add place="above">sad</add> effect of Love and Pride.&quot;
							I made her no answere; but dispairingly thought: and this will
							one day be my unhappy Case unless God exert his Almighty
							Power in rescuing me. 
						</p>
					<p>
							I soon followed my Mother privately to Reading giving all my
							Acquaintance the Slip; But was soon surrounded with my old
							Friends and Acquaintance who were very desireous to hear news, and
							learn more particularly the Fashions of the Town. I told them, I was
							quite tired of all those things, and therefore resolv&apos;d soon to retire from
							all, and come and live in a quite different way: If any of them w<hi rend="strikethrough">h</hi>ere
							inclin&apos;d to make one of the Company, when I came to settle at home,
							it could be made out.
						</p>
					<p>
							From this time I had no rest for my poor distresst Heart &amp; mind
							Therefore in my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year I left London the Last time, to put in practice
							what I had so long purposed, renewing my Acquaintance with the
							most solid and religious Part of my Friends. I followed as near
							as I could. Step for step, with my Mother &amp; Brother, who had
							begun some time ago a more religious Course of Life; But, alas!
							I grew faint hearted and tir&apos;d: And seeing all my Works, Prayers
							and Duties, good for nothing at all, and I myself that same de-
							plorable Creature as ever I was, I cry&apos;d out in the Bitterness of
							my Soul: O Lord Jesus Christ&apos; if this is the way to Heaven, I shall
							never come there! My distress still increased, being more &amp; more
							Sensible of my Degeneracy; But above all did my base ingratitude
							to my once so tender Lover fill me with horror and Dejection. 
						</p>
					<p>
							We had heard of the Awakening in Oxford, where my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> went,
							got acquainted with several, and brought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kinchin<hi rend="strikethrough">g</hi> to our house;
							and afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesleys, Hutchins, Whitfield &amp;c. I was much
							perplex&apos;d in my own mind at this rash (as I thought then) proceeding
							of my Brothers, fearing a Schism in the Church. But being convinced
							of the truth of their Doctrine, was soon Zealously attached thereto.
							But the Preaching being in our House, it made a great stir in the
							Town, and caused us much Trouble and disgrace; So that my Mother
							hearing of it in London, came home, and put an intire Stop to it.
						
					</p>

					<pb n="4" facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_68Cennick-04.jpg" />
					<p>
						
							Hereupon my Brother went to Bristoll, and I, and a well disposed singled
							Woman took a house in the Town; but the Preaching was given up.
							By these means got the ill Will of all my Friends and Relations
							My Acquaintance also shun&apos;d me, and every one&apos;s Face was set against
							me. Thus forsaken of all, and destitute of my best Friend, I grew
							dejected, and quite malancholy.
						</p>
					<p>
							In 1740 I visited Kingswood and Bristol; but could not be reconcil&apos;d
							to those Agitations among the Methodists at that time. Here I had
							happiness of seeing first our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Toellshig, who seeing my concern,
							help&apos;d me much. I soon return&apos;d to Reading exceedingly distress&apos;d,
							And finding my dear Companion so happy in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and myself
							so wretched, I gave up all hopes of ever being sav&apos;d. But here in
							one moment did my most gracious Saviour reveal Himself to me,
							forgave me all my sin, and in an instant I was dispossess&apos;d of every
							Pain: I could hardly tell if I was in the Body or not. For my heart
							saw nothing but Jesus. I felt after Sin; but behold! there was
							no Sin. I felt after my own guilt and Distress, but there was
							no Place found for them, and nothing but light surrounded me. 
							I had not enjoy&apos;d this happiness long, before my venerable Companion
							fell happily asleep on the Bosom of her eternal Bridegroom.
						</p>
					<p>
							At my return the former Disturbances were reviv&apos;d. many were
							distresst concerning their Salvation; And the Clergy being greatly
							perplex&apos;d, endeavour&apos;d to put me to Trouble; But our Saviour
							kept me stay&apos;d upon Him and deliver&apos;d me safe out of their Hands.
							I gave up my House, and went again to Kingswood, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitfield, my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and others were separated from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesleys, and
							had begun more regular Society, and gave me the care of the
							Single Women, with whom I labourd as well as I could;
							But knowing my own Insufficiency, and seeing many Irregularities
							creeping in among the Young People, I told my Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> this was not
							what suited me; and therefore I came to Reading, where a Widow
							Quaker Gentlewoman had long and often desir&apos;d I would stay with
							her and <hi rend="underline">take</hi>
								<add place="above">use</add> her House as my own. I did so, And all my Quaker
							Friends were exceeding kind to me, and earnestly wish&apos;d me to
							settle amongst them; I would have done it, but had no leave from
							our Savr in my own Heart. My Mind was secretly Hankering
							after a Cloister: But my Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> desiring my Assistance at
							Tetherton, I went to him, and with all the Money I had, Goods &amp;
							Furniture, engaged with him, and the Peace of God ruled &amp; rested
							upon us.
						</p>
					<p>
							In 44 I went on a Visit to London, where our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stonehouse
							brought me aquainted with my ever dearest Anna Johanna, with
							whom my Heart was tenderly united, as was hers to me.
						
					</p>

					<p>
						
							I had heard of the Order among the Single Sisters, and that it was
							something like a Nunery, which exacted my enquiry and I wish&apos;d once
							to see such a Choir. My Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had already contracted a large Acquaintance
							with the Brethren, and sometime after gave our Societies into their
							care and went on a Visit to Hhaag, and from thence to Ireland.
							In his Absence I had the favour of a Visit at Tetherton from our late
							d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple and Discipless, Christel, Anna Johanna &amp;c. The Discipless
							was particularly hearty with me to, whom, at first, I was somewhat
							reserved; But coming upon Heart Matters, I was quite openhearted,
							and she spoke to me in the most Comfortable and encouraging manner,
							telling me, how tenderly She and her Company felt towards me, and
							assuring me of our Saviours Thoughts of Peace concerning me.
						</p>
					<p>
							My Brother soon after return&apos;d, who told me yet more about the
							single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, and how earnestly he had Pray&apos;d our Savr to bring me 
							into their happy Circle, That he knew it was just a Regulation as
							would please me. Upon duly weighing the matter before our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I wrote
							to my much respected Friend, the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Discipless for leave to visit the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							in Germany, who readily granted me the favour. My Mother also
							at this time, was well inclin&apos;d towards to Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; But meeting with
							some unhpy Circumstances, she was turn&apos;d quite against them: And
							tho&apos; I was much Staggered, yet our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> preserved me, and gave me Courage
							of persevere in my Purpose. Yet I had it hard to get away, and was forc&apos;d
							to leave her against her Will.
						</p>
					<p>
							In March 1747 I arrived with many more English Brethen and
							Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> together with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; Sis Teltschig in Hhaag, where I m<hi rend="strikethrough">e</hi>et with
							the most cordial reception from our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple &amp; Discipless.
							The Congregation and its regulations I saw with wonder and delight;
							Especially that of the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. My first Intention only was to Visit
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, and not to become a Member thereof; But in London, on my
							way h<hi rend="strikethrough">e</hi>ither, being a Spectator at the Holy Communion, I was so affected
							that I forgott my Resolution; Till by Occasion, soon after my arrival,
							I grew Suspicious, till I was quite confus&apos;d. But having an unreserved
							Confidence to the late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Discipless, I told her all my Concern, who
							with the greatest tenderness &amp; Frankness clear&apos;d up those matters which
							had given me so much pain. I now became quite happy and saw
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in a right light, and the Beginning of that happy Period,
							which the H Ghost had so many years been preparing me for.
						</p>
					<p>
							I had the Grace to be received into the Congregation the same year,
							Was soon after Confirm&apos;d and in Jan 1748 was made a happy Partaker
							of the Lords Body and Blood in the H Communion. Here also I
							had the Grace to be admitted into the Class of Intercessors, and soon
							after set out with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boehler &amp;c. for England. Our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Papa,
							Mamma, the Mother, Anna Johanna &amp;c. accompanied us to Francfort,

					<p>
						
							where, after many Blessings, the rest day we proceeded on our Journey
							in the Peace of God, and blessing of the Congregation.
						</p>
					<p>
							After staying sometime in London, I was sent to Fulneck, where
							I was one of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Servants, Choir Servant &amp; Helper. In June
							1750 I was called to London, where I enjoy&apos;d many blessings in the
							Dear Disciples House in Bloomsbury Square. From whence I
							was sent to Dublin to have the Care of the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> There and in the
							north of Ireland. The same year I visited the North, and the Year
							after was sent there; where also, as in Dublin our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> accom-
							panied, blessed and prosper&apos;d me, gave me the Hearts of the Sisters,
							for whom I have ever retained the tenderest affection, and shall
							to my latest Breath. So that, notwithstanding the many heavy
							Circumstances, I enjoy &apos;d the still Communion with my Hearts
							best Friend; Nor were my many Faults, weaknesses and mistakes
							a hindrence thereto. 
						</p>
					<p>
							In Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1758 I got a Call to the Disciple House, from my
							dear Anna Johanna. And the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> arriv&apos;d S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ripley 
							and Matty Haley, who were most heartily receiv&apos;d by all, and
							especially by our own d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> little Choir in Ballunderry. 
						</p>
					<p>
							The 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Spoke the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to the Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and in the
								Afternoon
							we partook of the same. Particular meetings were appointed
							in all the Plans for the Reception of the above two Sisters, which

							And in the evening S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary sent to invite me into her house, where

							on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May I arrived with several more Brethern &amp; Sisters
							to my exceeding great Joy, having that long wish&apos;d for happiness

							Here I had the favour of Staying till the Close thereof, a time,

							where I enjoy&apos;d a real Sabatic season, Continuing in the most

							Fellowship with all. At the latter end of this year our dear
							Disciple House arrived to the universal great joy of all here; I
							had the Blessing of being present at the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Synod to the end;
							as also at that memorable Conclusion of the faithfull Labour of those
							two eminent Witnesses the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple &amp; Disciples of Jesus in May 1760.

							In which happy Sensation I left Hhuth Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi

							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rice to have the Care of some young Women, Collected
							from several Parts, there being only two Natives. As to outward

							Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Vogls<hi rend="superscript">ng</hi> in Caring for the S. Sisters and Great Girls of
							the Country Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>. I receiv&apos;d my Call with awe &amp; real bow-

							me as a Priestess of God. In Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I set out with a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. and his
							Daughter a great Girl, who had lived with me, for ockbrook,
							where she was to reside. We arrived there safe and well after
							a heavy Journey, and I stay&apos;d to refresh myself for several days
							among my old Acquaintance and then set out for Fulneck.
							On the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I came to Leeds where our late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shultze was
							waiting to bring me to Fulneck the next Day, and presented me
							with a very hearty Congratulatory Letter from my D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary
							We arrived at Fulneck ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Noon on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> and met with a
							very hearty Reception from all my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> old S. Sisters, and stay&apos;d
							till the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Jan; when I was brought to Gumersall Oeconomy be
							S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary and Ann Birkby. I felt well as soon as I enterd the
							House. Early the next morning the <add place="above">two</add> above mentioned Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							took their leave of us. I got alone into my little room and
							kept a hearty Band with my Best Friend, and with many 
							tears devoted myself afresh to him: Put Him in mind of his
							Promise viz: That He would once bring me into an
							Asylum, where I should enjoy a real Sabatic sea-
							son and Bridal Intercourse with Him, preparatory
							to his taking me into His arms and Bosom.
							He shewed me something more concerning my present call, than I
							found, Some others knew, and was to remain a sceeret between Him
							and me, I soon found myself at Home, and that he would bring
							me safely thro&apos;. I felt also that the Hearts of the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were tenderly
							inclin&apos;d towards me; so that we soon became one Heart and one
							Mind, and a Blessed Period commence&apos;d, tho&apos; under many Difficulties.
							Not long after, a certain Sabbatic mood and most intimat inter-
							course, between me and my Friend took Place; So that my
							Labour among the Souls, was my Delight, it per adventure
							I might happily gain some, to become lovers of this my so favourite
							Object. My Journeys were long and heavy, to go to the different
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>, and I being very weakly made me oft secretly sigh and weep be
							fore my Friend: For it being just the depth of the winter that I come here,
							made walking in those bad roads almost impracticable; But here I must
							mention with the greatest gratitude &amp; humility the more then
							Brotherly &amp; Sisterly love and Faithfullness of my good, old,
							venerable Hearts Watsons; Happy for me they were at this time

							My little Room has been a Cabinet of Jewels to me, Therefore I have
							long concluded, that if our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> took me home here in Yorkshire, I
							would die in my nest, and so slip away, as it were incognito
							Since our dr B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boehlor&apos;s Visitation here, our Family has been
							brought again into the injoyment of our Choir Graces with our Choir
							to our very great abasement.
						</p>
					<p>
							For this Year last past, I have felt that my time was out
							in Gumersal, and last summer thought I should get a Call after
							the Synod; but could never find out any Place where I could be sent
							to. I once kept a hearty Band with my Friend about it, at the
							Conclusion of which, and summing up the whole, I said to Him:
							&quot;Now would it not be better thou tookst me home to thy <add place="above">own dr</add> self.&quot;
							I had no room to suspect any thing of the kind, from what I felt from him
							at that time; But July last, As I was in the Chaple <add place="above">Garden</add> at Work, He drew near
							To me in an extraordinary manner, and discover&apos;d to me Such an Union
							&amp; oneness between Him &amp; me, as is altogether unutterable, tho&apos; I 
							did attempt to express something of it in a few Verses.
						</p>
					<p>
							From this time I had often gentle hints of a Change, of something that would
							take place, which should entirely suit me.
						</p>
					<p>
							In August last I got it Voilent Cold, which grew worse &amp; worse,
							And found my Lungs were infected. In the Beginning of Sept last,
							I felt myself strangly ill; so as I had never been before, which lasted
							some few nights &amp; days; And during the whole time, I was most happily
							Comforted with my Friends nearness, Insomuch that I felt no illness at all,
							only that I was weak and drowsy. One night, unasked for, He
							came Close to my Bedside, and stood there. My Heart saw Him,
							And my Soul adored Him! He dispersed intirely in a moment
							every painfull thought and Sensation, inwardly and outwardly
							I felt after one Wound and another sore; But behold! they were all
							healed. I felt after Sin, and there was no sin. I felt after misery
							and Dejection, But there was none to be found; And thus I was made
							sound and whole, except those pleasing Wounds of Love, which He
							had made long before in my enamour&apos;d Heart, But now more
							Deeply impress&apos;d.
						</p>
					<p>
							Now it was, He gave me, the soft impression of his Gracious
							intention Concerning me; while I silently worship&apos;d before Him.
							On the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lorel called on us in her return from
							Duckenfield, and was quite alarm&apos;d at my seeming bad state
							of Health, would not rest, But insisted on my going to Fulneck,
							To stay there for some time which I did; where I assisted in
							seeing the Sisters for the Communion, and could not forbear to 
							drop a word now and then concerning something, the very obscure of
							my happy Situation. On the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I return&apos;d to Gummersal, where
							my Disorder increased, And my Friend confirmed more

							Strongly what he had made allready manifest to me. I was very well
							seemingly, fix&apos;d and suited; But my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lorel could not be reconcil&apos;d
							to my staying at Gumersel, and I must own shew&apos;d more then Mothers
							Faithfulness and Affection: In these Circumstances she could not be
							prevailed upon to be Satisfy&apos;d, unless I came to Fulneck.
						</p>
					<p>
							I therefore set out in mere faith, with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Fowler and
							Joseph Peal Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
								<add place="margin">1769</add> and arriv&apos;d here safe, and meet with a very
							hearty Reception. The first d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heart which saluted me, was
							my most dear and venerable Heart Anna Johanna; I was also made
							happily sensable of that genuine Love and hearty affection of the
							Choir in general, And more especially <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi>
								<add place="above">from</add> all those in Office; so that
							that peace of God, and that Sabbath, which I never had heard any
							one possessing, at least so long before their Departure, accompanied
							me here also in the clearest manner, which begun at the time above
							mentioned, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> manifested Himself to me in such an
							especiall manner. But here I must mention some essential
							things, which I forgot to mention in their proper places, viz.
							After all that the Lord had done for me, and I was clear and well
							establish&apos;d in it: One Day, as He &amp; I were solacing ourselves in
							each others love, it came into my mind; But that oneness &amp; union
							which I had possessed in Him. I was not so clear in at this time: He
							shew&apos;d me, I was wholly in Him and He in me, and that we
							were One as he and the Father are One. I saw myself cloathed
							upon in Him, and possessed of all the Bridal Ornaments of the Bridegroom. 
							I must therefore ascribe all the Honour and Glory alone to my own d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
							eternal Slaughter&apos;d Lord and Saviour and conclude my
							Narrative with the Greatest truth in all the World: viz.
							That, Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded
							Much more.
						</p>
					<p>
							Our venerable and Happily departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Cennick,
							Has in some measure Specify&apos;d How varioussly her Election of Grace
							has <add place="above">been</add> manifested w<add place="above">h</add>ere-ever her happy Lot Has been cast, during

							Her Strong Capacity, Great Gifts, and quick sensations, was
							Iluminated by such extraordinary Grace from the H. Ghost
							As evidently Signalized Her a peculiar Person of Blessed
							remembrance to the Hearts of many Souls.
						</p>
					<p>
							Yet amidst all those great Endowments, she had the
							Happiness, through the infinite Mercys of God, to be throughty
							Convinced of her great depravity in Soul and Body, and
							which truly as a monument of uncommon Mercy and Grace, 
							was preserved, in her Earlyest years, From the dangers and
							vain Foibels of her natural Inclinations, and as her own
							words has spoke it, she counted it the highest Dignity

							By these Veres somithing may be understood of that truly
							Evangelical intercourse, which our late happy Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had with
							her Souls Bridegroom; She has certainly been favour&apos;d with a
							more than common union and nearness from her Friend &amp; Lover.
							Her Soul magnify&apos;d the Lord, and her Spirit daily rejoiced in God
							her Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> whom she recommended on all Occasstions, with such
							energy, as is not to be expresst in words, which bears an Indelible
							Signature of Blessing in her Choir. During her last Sickness
							we have seen many Blessed Testemonies of this Kind, wherein
							she has plainly shown, that her very Soul was animated with
							new life whenever our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> or his matters was named,
							Especially with regard to the General and Individual Intercourse
							which our dear Lord should have in the Choir. On Consideration
							of our dear Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Situation, and Circumstances in Sickness at
							Gumersall, At our desire she remov&apos;d to end her days in the 
							midst of her Choir at Fulneck, yet she retained the same Love
							and Concern, for her dear Gumersall Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, to whom we
							perceiv&apos;d on all Occassions, she had the tenderest attachment
							And her hearts Connexion with the Fountain of Love defus&apos;d it
							self thro&apos; the whole Choir. For notwithstanding her great
							weakness, she desir&apos;d to see the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Room by Room, took a
							most tender and solemn farewell of them all; Like wise Little
							Moore &amp; Gumersall Oeconomies, The Latter of which, she desir&apos;d
							to see once again, when her Dissolution was perceptably hastening,
							which was a most moving scene, To Behold and feel with what power
							and grace, she gave her last Benediction to that dear Oeconomy
							Where she had finishe&apos; her faithfull Labour in this Crosses Kingdom

							From this time her weakness increas&apos;d more sensibly, which
