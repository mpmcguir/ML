                     of England</orgName> and brought me up in the same, as far as I can remember my
                  first thought of being fared was thro' hereing my <persName>Mother</persName>
                  speak with another what time Children begun to be anserable for Sin and they
                  thought at Seven-years, this had such an impression on my mind that I often went
                  alone and wish'd <persName type="deity">God</persName> wou'd let me die before
                  that time for then I took it for granted I should be saved, <date when-iso="1729"

                  perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul and Body, when I was
                  there they sent me into a Feild to work where I was so cold that I had no feeling
                  of Hands nor Fat nor could I come to any House, all on a sudden it came in my mind
                  that <hi rend="superscript"><persName type="deity">God</persName></hi> could warm
                  me and I grew directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot

                  any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a nother
                     <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and
                  intended to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a
                  constant condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own

                  satisfaction in her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for her to go and
                  live with two or three <roleName en="honorific">Sisters</roleName> who' was under
                  the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> care which she took very

                  heart very dry and her being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very
                  heavy for her to fell as a Sinner depart alone upon our <roleName type="honorific"

                  heavy in the Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place
