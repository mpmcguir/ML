					<p> The life of <persName ref="#mlper000554">Joseph Haley</persName> who has
						left the following in writing I was born at <placeName>Little
							Town</placeName> in the <placeName ref="#mlpla000030">Parish of
							Birstall</placeName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000084"
							>Yorkshire</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1727-06-25">June 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> 1727</date>. My Parents were very poor &amp; belong&apos;d
						to the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName>, but <date
							notAfter="1736" cert="medium">before I was 11 years old</date>, I was
							<name occupation="apprentice">bound Prentice</name> for the Space of 10
						Years to a Broad <name occupation="clothier">Clothier</name>, which I
						faithfully served in <placeName>Hardshead Parish</placeName>. In the middle
						of my time <persName ref="#mlper000536">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
							Ingham</persName> &amp; <persName>Delamotte</persName> began to preach
						at <placeName>Smith House</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Rawhead</placeName>,
						where I often went to hear them &amp; got a lively Impression of the Friend
						of Sinners. But my Master being a Cross old Man, he would not let one go to
						hear the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, and as my time
						was almost out, I begd our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to keep me near his Person. My
						time being out I hired myself with another Master, who was a <orgName
							religion="methodism">Methodist</orgName>, when I became more Religious
						than before but could never get any Satisfaction &amp; my heart grew very
						dead &amp; cold. A the end of my Year I went to live at
							<placeName>Hallifax</placeName> to be an <name occupation="holster"
							>Hostler</name>, there I plung&apos;d myself into all manner of
						wickedness. Soon after I went to live at <placeName ref="#mlpla000050"
							>Leeds</placeName> where I was a <name occupation="servant">Gentlemans
							Servant</name>, here I became still more wicked &amp; miserable <hi
							rend="strikethrough">being</hi>
						<add place="margin">tho&apos; I was</add> always accused in my Mind &amp;
						knowing at the same time my Course was hurtfull to body &amp; Soul, so that
						my Life become burthensome to me.</p>
					<p> My Mother being a good old <orgName religion="methodism">Methodist</orgName>
						&amp; knowing of my going on She was much dissatisfied with me, &amp; often
						desired me to come home &amp; settle to my own Business, but I found it very
						difficult to leave my old wicked Companions, thinking I was fit for no other
						Company. Now my <name type="emotion">Confliction was broke</name> &amp; I
						was befall&apos;n with a <name health="disease">sore Sickness</name>, which
						reduced me to great poverty &amp; being hardly fit for any thing, I then
						began to wish, that I could have called back the Time I had lost &amp; Spend
						without our Saviour.</p>
					<p> Having served in this place 4 Years and 5 Months I left my Master &amp; went
						to live with my Parents at <placeName>High Town</placeName> but </p>

					<p> did not know what Course to take, for I was like a Spotted Bird even amongst
						the worldly People. I went again to hear the <orgName religion="methodism"
							>Methodists</orgName> however here I could find no comfort &amp; my poor
						Heart felt always dissatisfied which made me resolved to go &amp; hear the
							B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> but I always found Something to hinder
						me. Soon after it happened that I went to live with <persName>W<hi
								rend="superscript">m</hi> Taylor</persName> a Single Man of
							<persName>Cleckheaton</persName> who belongs to the <orgName>B<hi
								rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>. Hearing that there was a very
						pious <name office="minister">Minister</name> at <placeName>White
							Chapple</placeName> I went to hear his <name event="religious"
							>Sermons</name>, but as he pre<add place="above">a</add>ched only the
						Law, I soon got a Dislike &amp; in the beginning of the Year <date
							when-iso="1757">1757</date> I went to hear <persName><roleName
								type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
							Pyrleaus</persName> who preachd on these Words: <roleName
							type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, save us, we perish, <name
							type="emotion">there my heart was laid so hold of that I shall never
							forget it.</name> Having great uneasiness of Mind, I wished for an
						opportunity to speak with a <roleName type="honorific">B<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> which happened soon after to my
						great Satisfaction. I also got leave to come to the Classes of the Single
						Men &amp; in <date when-iso="1757-03">March <hi rend="strikethrough">the
								same Year</hi></date>
						<date when-iso="1759"><add place="above">1759</add></date> I was <name
							event="reception">received into the Society</name>, at which I felt our
							<roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> very near to me. I beg&apos;d
						He might keep me close to Him. I being so exposed to the world made me think
						I should never come thro&apos;. I often came to <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; saw the <orgName>B<hi
								rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> lived so happy together as I
						never saw People live before, I thought I could never be rightly happy
						unless I was there. Yet I could never offer to ask for it feeling my own
						Misery &amp; wickedness I thought they would never allow in to come there.
						In this way I continued like a Standing Water till <date when-iso="1760-03"
								><add place="above">March</add> 1760</date> when my
							<roleName>Master</roleName>
						<persName>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Taylor</persName> got leave to
						move into the <placeName>Choir House</placeName> which <name type="emotion"
							>caused me many Tears</name> thinking our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> had left me alone to
						myself on account of my unfaithfulness, what would become of me I did not
						know. As I was very uneasy &amp; being resolved to become our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> I desired
						leave to live in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003"
							>Fulneck</placeName> which I also obtain&apos;d &amp; moved thither
							<date when-iso="1760-10-20">Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760</date> very glad &amp; thankfull.
							<date when-iso="1761-03-23">March 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
							1761</date> I was <name event="reception">received into the <orgName
								en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName></name>
						which was a great Blessing to me. In <date when-iso="1761-07">July</date> I
						had a <name health="disease">hard Sickness</name>, in during which our
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						gave me a new Seal of </p>
					<p> my Grace Election &amp; comforted me about all past things. <date
							when-iso="1761-12-20">Decr 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761</date>
						I was made a partaker of my Lords Corpse &amp; Blood in the <name
							event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name> which was an unspeakable Grace
						to me, &amp; I esteemed this Year a Year of Blessings bestowed upon me,
						which I shall never be able to express, &amp; I wish that I may always have
						that Impression of it till our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> calls me home to himself. Oh!
						could I but always prize my Call &amp; Election sufficiently &amp; thank our
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						that he has granted me a nest amongst his People I cannot but be ashamed
						that my heart does not burn more in Love towards Him. Thus far his own
						words.</p>
					<p> In the <date when-iso="1763">Year 1763</date> he got a Call to go to
							<placeName ref="#mlpla000025">Bedford</placeName>, of which he accepted
						in a Childlike manner &amp; served the<orgName> B<hi rend="superscript"
								>rn</hi></orgName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000025"
							>Bedford</placeName> as <name occupation="cook">Cook</name> for several
						Years &amp; then went to <placeName ref="#mlpla000035"
							>Duckenfield</placeName>. On <date when-iso="1767-03-26">March 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1767</date> he came again to live here
						&amp; went on in a happy Course. In the beginning of <date
							when-iso="1770-06">June 1770</date> he went to <add place="above">live
							in</add> the <orgName en="œconomy">Oeconomy</orgName> at <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000059">Mirfield</placeName>. He was Naturally a peevish
						Temper, but his plain Honest &amp; upright way of acting made him beloved
						amongst his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He was free &amp; openhearted
						with his Labourer nor did he speak better of himself than it was. He often
						felt the oppression of his Sickly Tabernacle, especially in the Spring and
						Autumn, but this last Spring it soon appeared that his <name
							health="disease">Sickness was a Consumption</name> &amp; that he would
						not recover again on which account he wishd to come to <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; go home in the
							<placeName>Choirhouse</placeName> last here, which was also granted him,
							<date when-iso="1772-07-11"><add place="above">last</add> July the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi></date> for which he was very thankful. He
						spend his time in the <placeName>Sick Room</placeName> in a true Concession
						with our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>, waiting with resignation for the happy Hour of his
						Dissolution which came to pass the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant,
						when our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> took him happily to himself as a Sinner who had found
						Grace in His Death and Sufferings. </p>
