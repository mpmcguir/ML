					<l>Memoirs</l>
					<l>of our much beloved late Sister Henriette</l>
					<l>Mary Louise V. Hayn; who on the 27<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>of Aug: 1782 at Herrnhut entered into</l>
					<l>the Joy of her Lord.</l>
					<l>She left the following Account concerning</l>
					<l>herself, Louisel that poor Sinner would </l>
					<l>rather lie weeping at the feet of Jesus, then say</l>
					<l>anything touching her Pilgrimage here below:</l>
					<l>But ah! In love to my Soul he has been very</l>
					<l>gracious to me, and therefore I cannot keep</l>
					<l>silence, but am moved in simplicity of heart</l>
					<l>to give to my dearest Brethern &amp; Sisters a</l>
					<l>Narrative of what He hath done to my Soul.</l>
					<l>I was born May 28<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1724 at Idstein a Town</l>
					<l>in Nassau. My Father was George Henry V.</l>
					<l>Hayn Cheif Forester in all the Principality</l>
					<l>of Nassau, born in Lower Lusatia, where my</l>
					<l>Grand Father had his Estates. My Mother was</l>
					<l>Ernestine V. Losberg from Oettingen in Swabia</l>
					<l>Her Father when a Child of 7 Years, emigrated</l>
					<l>with his Mother out of Austria for the sake</l>
					<l>of Religion forsaking all their Relations and</l>
					<l>Estates. Poor I, and indeed one of the meanest</l>
					<l>of Gods Creatures, as far as I can recollect felt</l>
					<l>my Saviours Love from my tenderest Infancy.</l>
					<l>When a little Child I frequently had such a</l>
					<l>tender Sensation of his Love, that I some times</l>
					<l>retired to a Corner and cry&apos;d, and no body knew</l>
					<l>why. The lovely Work of Grace, which the Holy</l>
					<l>Ghost carri</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>carried on in my tender heart is still new to me</l>
					<l>to this very hour. By occasion of learning the</l>
					<l>first Verses by way of Prayer, as the Saviour&apos;s</l>
					<l>Blood &amp; Righteousness &amp;c. I felt and tasted already</l>
					<l>something of that dear &amp; precious blood, and re-</l>
					<l>ceived such lively Impressions of the dear suff-</l>
					<l>ering Lamb of God, which continued with me through</l>
					<l>out my whole Life. Once in quite a miraculous</l>
					<l>manner a Herrnuttish or Moravian little Doctrin-</l>
					<l>al Book for Children happened to come into my</l>
					<l>hands. It was just the thing that suited my taste</l>
					<l>when I was reading it I frequently kissed this</l>
					<l>little Book, carried it about me by day &amp; night </l>
					<l>for fear of its being taken from me. When I</l>
					<l>grew bigger, and was then under continual Inspecti-</l>
					<l>on, my constant study was, how to contrive to</l>
					<l>slip away for a little while in order to think on</l>
					<l>Jesus or to pray to him. When I could not succeed</l>
					<l>in the day time, I got up in the Night when</l>
					<l>all was fast asleep, and spent many an hour</l>
					<l>upon my krees, for my heart was verily burn-</l>
					<l>ing for with Love toward Jesus. When we went a walk-</l>
					<l>ing I sometimes contrived it, to stay a little</l>
					<l>behind, prostrated quickly on the Ground, as if I was</l>
					<l>wanting to pick flowers, and kissed the Ground</l>
					<l>thinking childlikely that was the spot where</l>
					<l>my dearest Jesus sweated Bloody sweat.</l>
					<l>In my 13<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year I went for the first time to the</l>
					<l>H. Sacrament in a Lutheran Church, and received</l>
					<l>this highest Good with deepest Reverence &amp; Awe.</l>
					<l>After this, according to the custom of the World,</l>
					<l>they began to introduce me more into Company;</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and as particularly some sensible persons and</l>
					<l>people of quality did very pretty with me and</l>
					<l>courted me, it proved a great hurt to my heart</l>
					<l>for I also strove to render myself agreable,</l>
					<l>and the good Understanding I was in with my dear</l>
					<l>Saviour, gradually ceased, instead of this fear</l>
					<l>and Shyness look place in me, so that I no more</l>
					<l>so childlikely could apply to him. my thoughts</l>
					<l>were accusing, or else excusing one another, and</l>
					<l>I came into distress &amp; Misery on account of the </l>
					<l>Loss of the happiness in my Soul. I kneel&apos;d down</l>
					<l>a hundred times, entreating our Saviour with tears</l>
					<l>to have Mercy on me again, and telling him, that</l>
					<l>I neither could nor would love any thing in this World</l>
					<l>but him alone; but a hundred times I was made sen-</l>
					<l>sible again, that it was not true, &amp; that so easily</l>
					<l>something else could engage my unsteady Soul and</l>
					<l>mind. Thus I went on for several years in a con-</l>
					<l>tinual Lamentation about myself, and the loss</l>
					<l>of my former Familiarity with our dear Saviour.</l>
					<l>Everything in the World that comonly yields pleasure</l>
					<l>to young people, became disgustful to me. About</l>
					<l>this time I got to read the Berlin Discourses, which</l>
					<l>proved a great Comfort to me. I heard also a great</l>
					<l>deal of talk about a new Place in Wetteravia called</l>
					<l>Herrnhag, which the Herrnhuters were a building</l>
					<l>on account of which I felt an inexpressible joy.</l>
					<l>Notwithstanding the accounts that were given </l>
					<l>me concerning the Bretherns Congregations were </l>
					<l>the most contemptible, I always believed the </l>
					<l>contrary, and was fully assured within my heart, </l>
					<l>that this very People was my People, with whom</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>I wanted to live and to die; tho&apos; I never yet had seen</l>
					<l>a Brother or Sister. My only anxious Concern</l>
					<l>was how can it possibly be brought about to bear</l>
					<l>that I should get my place among them? Mean-</l>
					<l>while I neglected no Oportunity where I could</l>
					<l>disclose to my Parents my thoughts about the</l>
					<l>new Phenomenon (appearance) of the Kingdom</l>
					<l>of God on Earth, and how much my heart was</l>
					<l>drawn towards it; but I perceived plain enough</l>
					<l>that I never could expect such a thing as to</l>
					<l>obtain their consent for my going to the Bretherns</l>
					<l>Congregation, without grieving them the utter</l>
					<l>most and yet, l loved them as much as my</l>
					<l>own Life. However when one Morning, as I</l>
					<l>usually did, was reading to my Father out of the</l>
					<l>New Testament, and I happened to come to these Words</l>
					<l>of our Saviour&apos;s as He that loveth Father or Mother</l>
					<l>more then me, is not worthy of me. I was so </l>
					<l>struck that I laid down the Book, as if I was</l>
					<l>obliged to go about some business, hastened to my</l>
					<l>Room and wrote a Letter to my Father upon</l>
					<l>the subject of the above Words, declaring to him</l>
					<l>with many tears in a most moveing &amp; submissive</l>
					<l>manner; that I now was no longer able to resist</l>
					<l>the divine Calling in my heart, and therefore was</l>
					<l>obliged to rise and to set out directly for Herrnhag.</l>
					<l>I did so, and set off immediately, without look-</l>
					<l>ing after anything, took the Letter with me, and</l>
					<l>when I got into the first Village, sent it back to</l>
					<l>my Parents house. Tho&apos; such a step appeared</l>
					<l>very extraordinary and bold to a high degree, and</l>
					<l>tho&apos; it caused me a great deal of trouble (for my</l>
					<l>Parents sent directly after me and fetched me</l>
					<l>back from Frankfurt) yet it proved the means</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of my being set at liberty for some sensible</l>
					<l>Persons advised my Parents, to send me only</l>
					<l>for a short time to Herrnhag being confident,</l>
					<l>that I there would soon be convinced of my error</l>
					<l>and thus be cured of it forever. In consequence</l>
					<l>of this good advice I was expeditiously and very</l>
					<l>loveingly conveyed to Herrnhag for a Visit. Nov.</l>
					<l>the 5<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1744, was that to me ever blessed day, when</l>
					<l>I arrived at Marienborn and saw for the first</l>
					<l>time Brothers and Sisters, Such a Peace of God</l>
					<l>and feeling of the Congregation Spirit directly sur-</l>
					<l>rounded and pervaded me, as is always new to me,</l>
					<l>whenever I think on it. The Pilgrims Congregation</l>
					<l>happened then to be there, and our Saviour let me</l>
					<l>find favour with all the B<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rs</hi> but especially</l>
					<l>with the late dear Disciple, tho&apos; I was yet such a</l>
					<l>great Stranger. I had forsaken a couple of dear</l>
					<l>Parents, but here it was to me as if I had found at</l>
					<l>once hundred Fathers &amp; Mothers, so loving did I</l>
					<l>feel the hearts of all the Brethern &amp; S<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rs</hi>: towards</l>
					<l>poor me; and I was indeed like a Child, that is</l>
					<l>arrived from abroad in it&apos;s own Mother&apos;s house</l>
					<l>and among its kindred. After having been over</l>
					<l>poured with Grace &amp; Love for several weeks in that</l>
					<l>dear House Marienborn, and the dear Disciple&apos;s</l>
					<l>taking all pains on my account, and willing</l>
					<l>himself to my Father, offering himself to take me</l>
					<l>as his own child; I got Leave to move into the</l>
					<l>Sing. Sisters House at Herrnhag. I was not</l>
					<l>long there before the Holy Ghost begun a Work</l>
					<l>of Grace in my heart, I was very Simple and</l>
					<l>upright in telling every thing that was cleared up</l>
					<l>to me at that time, and whatever I could gather</l>
					<l>to accuse myself for; for I observed that I was want-</l>
					<l>ing in point of Sinnership, &amp; felt a longing</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>longing desire for it. I fought will many tears</l>
					<l>for Forgiveness in his Blood with regard to every</l>
					<l>thing that had occurred in my Life and that</l>
					<l>was not good. I got also the assurance of his</l>
					<l>Pardon, and was richly comforted. However the</l>
					<l>true self knowledge, and radical lure of Soul</l>
					<l>and Body were reserved to me for another period.</l>
					<l>According to the insight which I have at present</l>
					<l>into my case at that time, I was then carried</l>
					<l>away directly with the Stream of Grace &amp; had</l>
					<l>not time rightly to reflect on myself. It was</l>
					<l>first then the Period of the Litany of the Wounds</l>
					<l>of Jesus, and of the Hymns concerning his</l>
					<l>Wounds. Whoever did experience it at that</l>
					<l>time, will know best how powerful Grace then</l>
					<l>was. I pass overall the great difficulties</l>
					<l>arising between my Parents &amp; me, for half a</l>
					<l>year after I had left them, they demanded me</l>
					<l>back again, and as the late Disciple himself</l>
					<l>was apprehansive of various disagreable Conse-</l>
					<l>quences, I was obliged by his own positive Order</l>
					<l>to return once more to my Parents; however he</l>
					<l>assured one at the same time, that I should soon</l>
					<l>come back again, which actually came to pass. Our</l>
					<l>dear Saviour help&apos;d me in a most wonderful manner</l>
					<l>so as to be entirely set at liberty and brought me joyful</l>
					<l>and happy back again to my dear Herrnhag. In the</l>
					<l>year 1746 on the 30<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> of Jan<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>y</hi>, I became Partaker of the</l>
					<l>Body &amp; Blood of the Lord in the H. Sacrament for the</l>
					<l>first time with the Bretherns Congregation, with </l>
					<l>a right hungry soul, but so abashed, that it seemed</l>
					<l>to one, as if this Grace and Favour was much too</l>
					<l>great. In the same Year I moved into the Girls house</l>
					<l>for the Instruction of Children and lived with the Girls</l>
					<l>then I moved with the Oceonomy to Mareinborn, and</l>
					<l>in the year 1747 came with the Same back again to Herrenhag.</l>
					<l>As to the various Periods, which in a kind of constant</l>
					<l>Transport I passed through with the dear Congregation</l>
					<l>at Herrnhag, I dare not venture to say any thing </l>
					<l>particularly upon that Topick: Thus much I</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='7'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>I know with respect to myself, that I frequently</l>
					<l>felt powerful Grace, but for want of a Sinner</l>
					<l>Foundation I could not improve it rightly. Our</l>
					<l>Saviour be praised eternally! who in Love and</l>
					<l>Mercy to his poor sheep led them soon back to the</l>
					<l>wholesome Pasture of his Wounds, without harm &amp;</l>
					<l>loss to any one, whose heart at that time kept him</l>
					<l>in view. In the Year 1750 the Girls house lost their</l>
					<l>dear Justine Schweiniz, who had the Care of that </l>
					<l>house for several years, and I was put into her</l>
					<l>place, after having been received an Acoluth, and</l>
					<l>blessed a Deaconess of the Bretherns Church already</l>
					<l>in the year 1748. In the Year 1750 I emigrated</l>
					<l>with the Girls Oeconomy to Upper Lusatia, and our</l>
					<l>first Place of abode was the Castle of Hannersdorf</l>
					<l>till in the year 1751 in March we moved to dear H.hut</l>
					<l>into that blessed House where I might fall prostrate</l>
					<l>and adore, whenever I enter into it and call to mind</l>
					<l>what unspeakable blessings were reserved saved for me</l>
					<l>that I might enjoy them in that House. The Remem-</l>
					<l>brance of a thousand Cares &amp; Sorrows attending the</l>
					<l>Office I was entrusted with among such a large</l>
					<l>number of Children, is indeed as if they were it was wiped</l>
					<l>away out of my mind. So much I recollect still</l>
					<l>what a painful and distressing thing it was; to see</l>
					<l>so many children hurt in their constitutions in</l>
					<l>consequence of the violent Draught of air prevail-</l>
					<l>ing in that House &amp;c &amp;c.</l>
					<l>That blessed Spirit the H. Ghost had in these and in</l>
					<l>the succeeding years his dilight with our dear little</l>
					<l>Children, and perfected out of the Mouth of these</l>
					<l>Babes powerful Praise to our dear Saviour.</l>
					<l>However this is a thing very well known, &amp; there was</l>
					<l>nothing left such an indelible impression upon</l>
					<l>my heart, as the deeply humbling Sensation, which</l>
					<l>I had of my Insufficiency, Defects &amp; Mistakes, not</l>
					<l>withstanding my best Intention and good Will.</l>
					<l>But what at that time during these Songs of Praise, of</l>
					<l>his Babes, was done, to the Soul, of his unworthy</l>
					<l>Handmaid I cannot pass over in silence, but will</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='8'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>give a Simple Narrative of it. Notwithstanding</l>
					<l>all the Grace and Mercy which hitherto I had ex-</l>
					<l>perienced and enjoyed, there remained yet in the bottom</l>
					<l>of my heart an incessant longing for attaining to a</l>
					<l>nearer Connexion with our Saviour, and I got into</l>
					<l>a state of Mourning, which in the beginning I could</l>
					<l>not understand; till in the year 1751 the late Disciple</l>
					<l>began to keep separate Conferences with some of us.</l>
					<l>which our Saviour made a means of promoting</l>
					<l>my eternal Felicity. He spoke to us, as it appear-</l>
					<l>ed to me, with extraordinary clearness concerning</l>
					<l>the New birth of the heart, the purifying of our</l>
					<l>Souls, the Necessity of becoming one Spirit with the</l>
					<l>Lord, the Sanctification, without which none shall</l>
					<l>see his Face. During his speaking upon these</l>
					<l>subjects a light began to shine in me, whereby</l>
					<l>I discovered clearly what was still wanting in me</l>
					<l>and what the H. Ghost had already spoken about to</l>
					<l>my heart for a considerable time. Now a new</l>
					<l>Work of God commenced in my heart, I got clearly</l>
					<l>to see the State which my Soul was in; the fall of Man</l>
					<l>was appropriated to me in such a manner, as if</l>
					<l>I myself personally had comitted the Crime; I</l>
					<l>got to feel it most sensibly, how both Soul &amp; Body</l>
					<l>were mortally wounded, and that there was no</l>
					<l>soundness in the whole Man. All former Ex-</l>
					<l>periences of our Saviour were as if taken away</l>
					<l>from me, and I beheld myself like one on the</l>
					<l>brink of Destruction, full of dread and horror.</l>
					<l>This was the condition I was in till once during</l>
					<l>a Night Watch, which in those days I kept several</l>
					<l>times, the Holy Ghost presented to my mind the</l>
					<l>sorrowful Creator, bemoaning his fallen Creature</l>
					<l>Man, grieving on account of his spiritual Death</l>
					<l>and then at once fixing upon that noble Deter-</l>
					<l>mination to become Man. Then it was to me</l>
					<l>as if all the Angels in heaven were proclaiming</l>
					<l>Peace to me. That was an important hour when</l>
					<l>for the first time again I got confidence to call upon</l>
					<l>Jesus and to weep for him. It was as if every</l>

					<l>Fragment of Memoir of Louisa von Hayn dep Aug 27 1782</l>
					<l>It was as of every Drop of Blood within me was cry-</l>
					<l>ing after my Redeemer, my Advocate, to justify</l>
					<l>me before the Throne of God, and to declare me as</l>
					<l>his redeemed Child. These were indeed unutterable</l>
					<l>gronings which the H. Spirit himself made within</l>
					<l>me. But I discovered to no body, even not to my</l>
					<l>most intimate Friends about me, what was car-</l>
					<l>rying on within me, except to the late Discipless</l>
					<l>to whom I thought it my Duty to disclose my heart.</l>
					<l>Meanwhile I was able to transact my business un-</l>
					<l>interruptedly, and under this Godly Sorrow I felt</l>
					<l>in the inmost recesses of my heart a happiness</l>
					<l>already. Once being quite at a loss, not know-</l>
					<l>ing what to do, having even no strength to weep or</l>
					<l>to pray I retired to a lonely place, prostrated</l>
					<l>myself of the Ground, and cryed aloud like a</l>
					<l>little Child after its Mother, when at once a Sab-</l>
					<l>batical Rest entered into my Soul. It was to me</l>
					<l>as if I was dipt &amp; sunk in Jesus Blood, and all</l>
					<l>my sense were soothed to quiet hushed. Then the bright day-Spring</l>
					<l>arose in my heart, like the Sun in his brightness</l>
					<l>breaking thro&apos; the Clouds. Whereas Peace, Peace, un-</l>
					<l>utterable Peace! I felt just like a new born Child,</l>
					<l>which by its Parents after hard Labour is tenderly</l>
					<l>embraced, kissed, suckled, fed, and lulled to sleep.</l>
					<l>O ye heavenly Moments! No human Comparison</l>
					<l>can ever come up to You! It was indeed to me as if </l>
					<l>every drop of blood in my veins, and all the Tears</l>
					<l>which were trickling down plentifully from my</l>
					<l>Cheeks were calling out, I am atoned for! I am</l>
					<l>reconciled! All that time I studiously shun&apos;d</l>
					<l>all Company, list any body should discover that</l>
					<l>something extraordinary happened to me; for I</l>
					<l>appeared to myself in all respects like a now Creature</l>
					<l>and from a Deep sense of my Unworthiness and</l>
					<l>low state wanted to hide myself like a Worm</l>
					<l>in the ground.</l>

					<l>This was of a truth entering into the Kingdom</l>
					<l>of Heaven to the enjoyment of the eternal Grace</l>
					<l>of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the most tender Affecti-</l>
					<l>on of any dear Father in Heaven, an admission into</l>
					<l>the most intimate Fellowship of the Holy Ghost</l>
					<l>an access to the Well of Watter Springing up</l>
					<l>into everlasting Life, to the Vine whose Sap</l>
					<l>penetrates the whole Man of God, both as to Soul</l>
					<l>and to the body. Thus I gradually got used to</l>
					<l>this new way of being happy, and the dear H. Ghost</l>
					<l>was early &amp; late imployed with me in admonish-</l>
					<l>ing, warning comforting, and especially in imprinting</l>
					<l>it deeply upon my hearty that all my Happenings</l>
					<l>and Felicty, is a very dear Purchase, even the</l>
					<l>Purchase of the Blood of Jesus Christ, in teaching</l>
					<l>me how to preserve this treasure in earthen yea</l>
					<l>in Sinful Vessels. Yea all the Divine Truths</l>
					<l>were laid before me to fresh &amp; lively, as if taken</l>
					<l>out of the first hand, and set in such a cleare</l>
					<l>light, that I am not able to express it sufficiently</l>
					<l>Especially our Father in Heaven, my &amp; my dearest</l>
					<l>Jesus Abba, was felt &amp; worshipped by this Recon-</l>
					<l>ciled Child with tender Affection beyond all esc-</l>
					<l>pression. My dear Saviour reveled himself to</l>
					<l>my Soul by degrees, and previous to each new</l>
					<l>Manifestation, there was always a new Contrition</l>
					<l>of the heart, a new Sensation of Depravity, and a</l>
					<l>weeping after his Soul. For his part, he was</l>
					<l>from Year to Year more gracious, more tender</l>
					<l>and more condesending, and for my part,</l>
					<l>I became poorer &amp; poorer and more begger</l>
					<l>like. To proceed farther in my Narrative,</l>
					<l>I think it neither needful nor profitable.</l>
					<l>His Passion, ah! his Passion! his bleeding</l>
					<l>and his dying, and that I poor little Worm</l>

					<l><hi rend='underlined:true;'>So much this dear Handmaid</hi> of Jesus</l>

					<l>ably distinguished, to the Blessing of so many </l>
					<l>kindred Souls, and concerning those precious</l>
					<l>Gifts where with she was adorned by her God &amp;</l>
					<l>Creator. But she was one that walked humb-</l>
					<l>ly with her Lord, did not please herself, and</l>
					<l>wanted no Praise &amp; Honour from Men; but</l>
					<l>found her greatest happiness in the Lowliness</l>

					<l>Therefore He who bestowed every good Gift on</l>
					<l>her shall receive thousand thanks &amp; Praise</l>
					<l>from us, for her beautiful Course of Grace, and</l>
					<l>for all which he thro&apos; her service has imparted</l>
					<l>to us. Her noble Character, and the Grace and</l>
					<l>Unction that rested upon her, as also the hap-</l>
					<l>piness of her heart, which lived wholly in our</l>
					<l>Saviour, is sufficiently known, out only by her</l>
					<l>delightful Hymns, but also her whole Demean-</l>
					<l>our, her Words &amp; edifying Walk &amp; Conversation.</l>
					<l>After She had laboured for 16 Year in the Girls</l>
					<l>House with unwearied motherly Care &amp; faithfulness</l>
					<l>as their Helper, she moved October 6<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1766 into</l>
					<l>the Choir House, to supply the Place of our dear</l>
					<l>late <hi rend='underlined:true;'>Caritas</hi> then going to <hi rend='underlined:true;'>Zeist</hi>, as Helper of the</l>
					<l>Single Sisters Choir here. In the years 1764 &amp; 1769</l>
					<l>She was present at the Bretherns <hi rend='underlined:true;'>Synods at Marien-</hi></l>

					<l>dorf &amp; Neudietendorf much to her satisfaction. In the</l>

				<lg>
					<l>In the suceeding Years she likewise pay&apos;d some</l>
					<l>blessed Visits to the Choir Houses of the Sing: Sister</l>
					<l>at Neusalz &amp; Gnadenfrey; Excepting these Excursio-</l>
					<l>ons, her dear Choir in Hhut had her in their</l>
					<l>midst these <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>16 years</hi> uninterruptedly, &amp; enjoyed</l>
					<l>her faithful Motherly Care in a manner, as is</l>
					<l>beyond all description, and as it never can be</l>
					<l>forgotten by us. At the same time the Prosperity of</l>
					<l>the whole Bretherns Unity, of the Congregation here, &amp;</l>
					<l>especially of all the Single Sisters Choirs lay so near</l>
					<l>her heart, that in her Prayre She not only frequent-</l>
					<l>ly was recomending them to our Lord, but also as-</l>
					<l>siduously studied what might be conducive to the</l>
					<l>executing of his Counsel of Grace. In the Congregation</l>
					<l>Conferences also she communicated her Ideas and</l>
					<l>Sentiments according to that Insight, which our</l>
					<l>Saviour had given her into his Cause. These many</l>
					<l>years she had a very troubelsome Cough, occasioned by</l>
					<l>catching cold, which continued increasing from year</l>
					<l>to year, and on account of which her strength was</l>
					<l>impairing. However she discharged her Office always</l>
					<l>with uncommon Clearness, thinking little on her</l>
					<l>bodily Weakness; at the same time the tender longing</l>
					<l>of the heart to be soon with that Friend, with whom</l>
					<l>she was so intimately connected, was increasing</l>
					<l>more &amp; more, on account of which our Saviour</l>
					<l>himself had to pacify her Soul, and to grant her</l>
					<l>Patience. Upon this head the frequently expressed</l>
					<l>herself in a moving manner, both in writing &amp; </l>
					<l>by word of mouth. In a letter, which she had writ-</l>
					<l>ten already three years ago to her own Sisters,</l>
					<l>She says among other things &quot;I perceive that I</l>
					<l>soon shall depart to my dear Saviour; for not</l>
					<l>only bodily strength is wasting fast; but I feel</l>
					<l>fast an extraordinary longing desire in my Soul</l>
					<l>to be at home with the Lord, and this is accompanied with</l>
					<l>this lively &amp; joyful home Amen, I shall have the</l>
					<l>Grace, soon to see my Jesus Face!&quot; Whenever in her</l>
					<l>hearty &amp; familiar Conversation, by which the heart</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>always could profit and be benefited, she happened</l>
					<l>to light on the subject of going home, and of</l>
					<l>the Church made perfect; She was quite in her</l>
					<l>Element and cheerfully recolected those dear</l>
					<l>hearts that were gone thither before her, especial-</l>
					<l>ly the late dear Disciple and S<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>r</hi> Caritas Ebbing.</l>
					<l>At the beginning of this Year she gave plainly to</l>
					<l>understand that she was pretty sure, that it would</l>
					<l>be the last of her Life. Her Weakness was percept-</l>
					<l>ibly increasing &amp; She declined using any means</l>
					<l>as those which she hither to had used proved to</l>
					<l>be without effect. But during this sickness the</l>
					<l>faithful Physcion of her Soul was in a quite pecu-</l>
					<l>liar manner occupied with her heart, concerning</l>
					<l>which the expressed herself to an intimate Friend</l>
					<l>of hers &quot;to the following purport, I am at present</l>
					<l>In a very important Season; our Saviour is</l>
					<l>Schooling me, and wants to discover still to me</l>
					<l>the least Dust that in me is not well pleasing</l>
					<l>to him. I have been minutely considering my whole</l>
					<l>Course of Life and found, that our Saviour indeed</l>
					<l>has bestowed upon me abundance of Grace &amp; Mercy</l>
					<l>but that I by far have not made such use of it</l>
					<l>as I might have done; I am ashamed at my In-</l>
					<l>dolence &amp; Negligence in discharging that precious</l>
					<l>Trust commited to me by our Saviour, out of</l>
					<l>mere Grace; and especially also on this account</l>
					<l>that I have not always received his Love, quite</l>
					<l>slowly melted &amp; Worm like. In the light of his</l>
					<l>Wounds he has discovered to me still many a</l>
					<l>selfishness, which his Blood must cleanse me</l>
					<l>from; therefore I am craving from the bottom</l>
					<l>of my heart, to receive once more a thorrough</l>
					<l>Absolution from our Saviour&quot;. When the blessed</l>
					<l>Passion Week was beginning and she was no more</l>
					<l>able to go out; She wished that in this view the </l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Pedilaviam might be administred to her in her</l>
					<l>room; which accordingly was done the night</l>
					<l>before Maunday Thursday after she once more</l>
					<l>has a tender Sinnerlike hearts Conversation</l>
					<l>accompanied with many Fears, and during a </l>
					<l>sensation of our Saviours most intimate Near-</l>
					<l>ness; concerning which the afterwards declared</l>
					<l>that our Saviour upon this occasion impressed</l>
					<l>once more his Seal upon her as his happy</l>
					<l>redeemed Sinner. <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>May the 4</hi><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi>. She enjoyed the</l>
					<l>body &amp; blood of our Lord once more in fellowship</l>
					<l>with her Choir. <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>May the 22</hi><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>d</hi> she celebrated her birth-</l>
					<l>day very weak indeed, however cheerful like a</l>
					<l>child, and was particularly happy on account of</l>
					<l>the fine Watch Word an that day: They shall</l>
					<l>not hunger, nor thirst; neither shall the heat</l>
					<l>nor sun smite them; for he that hath Mercy</l>
					<l>on them shall lead them, even by the Springs</l>

					<l>Were the Seraphs shine most bright</l>
					<l>Singing in eternal light,</l>
					<l>Holy Holy Holy! God,</l>
					<l>Father, Son, &amp; Spirit good!</l>
					<l>And when at night it was charmingly Sung by</l>
					<l>the Sisters in the Passage before her room, and</l>
					<l>accompanied with delightful Music, she Stept</l>
					<l>out and let her voice be heard for the last time</l>
					<l>in her Choir, with singing some Verses, which as</l>
					<l>her Farewell Blessing the Sisters joined in with</l>
					<l>Devotion. <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>June the 19</hi><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> when she called to</l>

					<l>Zinzendorf, she stirred herself up out of her great</l>
					<l>Weakness, and kept the <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>usual Conference</hi> with</l>
					<l>the <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Overseers</hi> of the rooms; upon which occasion</l>
					<l>the had a very impressive and sinnerlike</l>
					<l>Conversation with that Company, &amp; charged the</l>
					<l>Sisters to render Thanks to our Saviour, and to be</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>joyful in fellowship with her for her important</l>
					<l>Lot. Her Farewell Words then were; &quot;We abide</l>
					<l>unseperated I go to our Saviour to see him</l>
					<l>bodily and ye, my dear Sisters, continue tho&apos; not</l>
					<l>seeing to cleave quite close to him, till one after</l>
					<l>the other shall follow me.&quot; When in the suceeding</l>
					<l>Weeks the dear Brethern &amp; Sisters of the the U. E. Con:nec</l>
					<l>and so many other dear Acquaintances from other</l>
					<l>Congregations <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>arrived here</hi>, and upon this occasion</l>
					<l>came to see our dear <hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Louisel</hi>, She rejoiced heartily</l>
					<l>to see them once more and expressed her Love very</l>
					<l>feelingly. She took still Special share in the</l>
					<l><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Synod of the Bretherns Unity</hi>, and secretly &amp; diligent-</l>
					<l>ly blessed this Assimbly in her heart. Tho&apos; her</l>
					<l>Cough and her great Weakness seemed to prove</l>
					<l>more &amp; more troublesome to her yet she made</l>
					<l>no complaints on that account; but was at</l>
					<l>always thankful, that our Saviour made</l>
					<l>everything bearable to her, and her time pass</l>
					<l>away swiftly.</l>
					<l>Sometimes she broke out in the Words,</l>
					<l>&quot;Ah! The the delightful living Hope of eternal Life</l>
					<l>which renders one superior to all difficulties,</l>
					<l>and to every fear, which upon this occasion so</l>
					<l>easily shews itself in human nature.&quot;</l>
					<l>She looked upon this likewise as a special</l>
					<l>Blessing, that she was not confined to her bed.</l>
					<l><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Aug 22</hi><hi rend='underlined:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>d</hi>. She perceived that her Cough chang-</l>

					<l>for Joy. In the following days the swelling in</l>
					<l>her Legs increased more &amp; more, and contrary</l>
					<l>to her custom hitherto she had sleepless Nights</l>

					<l>Last Week of the Month of Aug. viz. the 25<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>on a Sunday, she rejoiced uncomonly &amp; wanted</l>
					<l>every body to rejoice with her, being confident</l>
					<l>that it was the last Week of her Life. Since that</l>
					<l>day she had scarce any rest, till on the 27<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> when</l>
					<l>at Noon a great Change was observed in her.</l>
					<l>From that time she lay very quiet like in a </l>
					<l>slumber, and only now &amp; then uttered a few Words.</l>
					<l>But her amicable looks continually testified to</l>
					<l>those that were standing round about her, how</l>
					<l>tenderly she loved, tho&apos; at the same time it was</l>
					<l>painful to behold her sufferings. In the Even</l>
					<l>ing half after an hour after 9 o&apos;Clock that by</l>
					<l>her so fervently wished for Moment came when</l>
					<l>her happy Soul, reconciled by the Blood of Jesus</l>
					<l>and pevaded by his Love, was carried home into</l>
					<l>his Arms to rest forever at his Wounds. Thus</l>
					<l>with the Blessing of the Congregation, and of her</l>
					<l>Choir she entered happily into the Joy of her</l>
					<l>Lord, during a feeling, tho&apos; painful on account</l>
					<l>of her Departure, yet thro&apos; the Peace of our Lord</l>
					<l>inly blessed &amp; happy, when at the same time we</l>
					<l>received the comfortable Assurance, that her Blessing</l>
					<l>will rest upon us, and that our dear Lord will</l>
					<l>cause her faithful Labour to be productive of</l>
					<l>fruit, To his own glory. May He grant us the</l>
					<l>Grace to follow her beautiful Example, till</l>
					<l>we be also completed.</l>
