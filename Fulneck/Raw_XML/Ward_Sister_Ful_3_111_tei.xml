					<l>Fulneck April 11<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1868.</l>
					<l>My dear B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Clemens,</l>
					<l>I first I am unable,</l>
					<l>at present, to draw up a proper</l>
					<l>Memoir of my dear departed</l>
					<l>wife. All I can do is</l>
					<l>merely to offer a few</l>
					<l>observations.</l>
					<l>She was born on the 10<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> of</l>
					<l>Sept. 1831 and is consequently</l>
					<l>in her 37<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year. For a long</l>
					<l>time she attended our Sunday</l>
					<l>school in Fulneck where</l>
					<l>the seed of the Gospel was</l>
					<l>sown in her heart. She liked</l>
					<l>to thinks of those days.</l>
					<l>In after times she became</l>
					<l>a member of the congregation,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and took a delight in</l>
					<l>the hallowed exercises of the</l>
					<l>Sanctuary.</l>
					<l>In 1853 she went to live</l>
					<l>in the Sister&apos;s House, where</l>
					<l>she continued until 1856;</l>
					<l>once in that year she</l>
					<l>received a call to Jamaica,</l>
					<l>where according to the grace</l>
					<l>given to her, she served</l>
					<l>with her husband in five</l>
					<l>congregations, in various parts</l>
					<l>of the island.</l>
					<l>By her quiet, unassuming</l>
					<l>behaviour, and taking a</l>
					<l>lively interest in any thing</l>
					<l>relating to the people, she</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>gained their respect and affection</l>
					<l>way a<unclear>wilited</unclear> the esteem of our</l>
					<l>fellow missionaries.</l>
					<l>She was an affectionate and</l>
					<l>devoted wife to her husband,</l>
					<l>a loving and tender mother,</l>
					<l>ever endeavoring to lead her</l>
					<l>children unto Him who has said,</l>
					<l>&quot;Suffer little Children to come unto me.&quot;</l>
					<l>Of a somewhat delicate</l>
					<l>constitution, she was frequently</l>
					<l>ailing and many a time has</l>
					<l>been laid down with bilious</l>
					<l>fever so common in the West</l>
					<l>Indies. A year ago we</l>
					<l>obtained permission to return to</l>
					<l>England, especially with a view</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of recruiting her health, but an</l>
					<l>allwise Providence has seen fit</l>
					<l>to ordain otherwise.</l>
					<l>The day previous to her departure,</l>
					<l>she had each of her Children brought</l>
					<l>to her bedsnde, and most tenderly</l>
					<l>embraced them, commanding them</l>
					<l>to the Lord. She then</l>
					<l>called for each one present, and</l>
					<l>had on affectionate &quot;farewell,&quot;</l>
					<l>saying a few appropriate words</l>
					<l>to each. She then began to </l>
					<l>repeat the lines</l>
					<l>&quot;Jesus makes my heart rejoice, &amp;c.&quot; </l>
					<l>She breathed her last while the old</l>
					<l>test. benediction was being pronounced.</l>
					<l>With kind love, You aff. brother,</l>
					<l>James Ward</l>
