					<l>The course of Life of Sister Mary Mortimer</l>
					<l>1765 I was born June ye 29 1709, in the Parish</l>
					<l>of Leeds of Relious Parents, who attend the Church</l>
					<l>of England in the stricktest manner, was also carefull</l>
					<l>to have me Educated in the principals and practice</l>
					<l>of the same, which I did not like, believing it time</l>
					<l>enough to become good and Religious, when one grew</l>
					<l>old and not deprive ones selfe of taking pleasure in </l>
					<l>ones younger years, but it was not long after those</l>
					<l>reflections but I got frequaint conviction about my</l>
					<l>future State, that continued till M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ingham began</l>
					<l>the Preaching in those parts, by means of which my</l>
					<l>convictions came more upon me, and I frequantly spoke</l>
					<l>to my dearest Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, who let me see my lost state and</l>
					<l>corrupted Nature in such a manner that I was frite</l>
					<l>frightend into deep dispair for upwards of five weeks</l>
					<l>together in this great distress being one day quite</l>
					<l>alone, I coud say nothing, tho&apos; my heart was fitt to break</l>
					<l>but dearest Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> make me willing to believe on Thee and</l>
					<l>immediatly a powerfull voice made answere ask for his</l>
					<l>Bloods sake, and this was repeated to me twice so loud</l>
					<l>that I was almost dumb with fear and amazement,</l>
					<l>but I spoke with a trembling voice, dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> for thy</l>
					<l>Blood sake help me, which <hi rend='underlined:true;'>he</hi> did that very moment</l>
					<l>and let me feel his rich forgiveness and total</l>
					<l>absolution of all my Sins, &amp; I felt his Blood so powerfully</l>
					<l>in my Heart as by words I cannot express the feeling, and</l>
					<l>those precious words was so imprinted upon my mind as if</l>
					<l>never to be forgoten by me hence forth. Ill bear this on</l>
					<l>my heart my all is purchas&apos;d by thy smart, Thy Blood</l>
					<l>Signs my release. So far her own words</l>

					<l>from this time our dear Sister became more chearfull</l>
					<l>and conversant with M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ingham B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Telche and</l>
					<l>others who at that time visited at her B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> House</l>
					<l>Of which she had the management and direction of</l>
					<l>the same and there by had many agreable oppertunity</l>
					<l>of refreshing the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> on the heartys manner</l>
					<l>when they calld upon them, and when the Sisters</l>
					<l>began the Oeconomy at Holm she made freequant</l>
					<l>little visits with her work, but did not venture</l>
					<l>with her thoughts so far, as to think that our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>cou&apos;d make her to such a Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> as those must be who</l>
					<l>coud in fellowship unite to live together for the </l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> sake, the feeling of her unworthyness made</l>
					<l>her often doubtfull &amp; disponding about our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> love</l>
					<l>towards her, &amp; in the year 1750 June ye 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> when her</l>
					<l>reception in the Congre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> was mad known to her, she</l>
					<l>was astonishingly surprisd and timerous to believe</l>
					<l>it, on this ocassion and thro&apos; her B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Rich<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ds</hi> Marrage</l>
					<l>the Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House became more dear and acceptable</l>
					<l>to her and in August following the same year </l>
					<l>she removed for good live amongst them, but her</l>
					<l>shiness towards our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> made her course anxious</l>
					<l>&amp; disponcng, till August 13<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1750 at which </l>
					<l>time our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> permitted her to become a participant</l>
					<l>of His holy Corps &amp; Blood, which she believ&apos;d</l>
					<l>some good Sister had interceeded to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> in her</l>
					<l>behalf, this grace brought her more to a Sinnerlike</l>
					<l>reliance upon her wounded Friend, and from this</l>
					<l>time she became more familier &amp; conversant with</l>
					<l>him and injoyd right happy Hours and days w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>the Con<hi rend='superscript:true;'>gn</hi> and he Choir, being fundamental</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>attachd to the Same in Principals and Practice</l>
					<l>of the same in which she had a real joy who ought</l>
					<l>was done to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Honour and when otherwise</l>
					<l>she was also pain&apos;d, she was one of those Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>who moved first into the Choir house, which</l>
					<l>happy lot of Grace was much esteemd and highly</l>
					<l>valu&apos;d by her and the fear of becoming Expencive</l>
					<l>to her Choir has made her live an Abstenious</l>
					<l>and very Industreous Course of life more so than has suted</l>
					<l>with her Constitution, or the desire of her Choir</l>
					<l>Sister who often otherwise advised her, but the</l>
					<l>woud say I am much ashamed to think how my dear</l>
					<l>est Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> causes both young and old in this House</l>
					<l>to love me and show such tender treatment as they do</l>
					<l>therefore I ought to do my best rather then be burd</l>
					<l>endsome in return, I know often pain my Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Heart by my anxious way of thinking, but hes so gracious</l>
					<l>he forgives me all and I hope you think on me before him</l>
					<l>which was a request she frequantly made use of in her</l>
					<l>conversation bands and Clases when she was with Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>that she thought had a close connection with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>having always a poor opinion of her self, the results of</l>
					<l>the late general Synod had a moving effect upon her</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> 12 words came so closly on her faults of deviation</l>
					<l>that her very Marrow and Bone was sized with holy awe</l>
					<l>trembling, but the obsolving Grace of her Hearts best</l>
					<l>Friend comforted and heald all her back Slidings, and</l>
					<l>she was truly thankfull that sheaken those days and</l>
					<l>the dear Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>, and when spoke with by her Labrouse</l>
					<l>to the Holy Sacrament, she was Childlike senceable</l>
					<l>of her great unworthyness to such grace and her great</l>
					<l>Humility gave one a real attachment to her</l>
