					<l>Some particulars of the life of the late Sing. Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Martha Walker, written by herself.</l>
					<l>I was Born Dec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi>. 1725 at Cheadly Home in ye Parish</l>
					<l>of Stockport Chesher and Bap&apos;d in ye Church of England, but brought up a</l>
					<l>Presb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> to which religion persuasion my Mother belong&apos;d as I don&apos;t remember</l>
					<l> any thing particular of my Chil<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ns</hi> years, I shall pass over that time</l>
					<l>without saying any thing of it of that time till I came into my 16<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year about which</l>
					<l>time I left my Father&apos;s House &amp; went to service when not long soon after my</l>
					<l>Father dep&apos;<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> this life leaving my Mother with Five Chil<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of whom</l>
					<l>I was oldest, and being naturally of a thinking Disposition I was brought</l>
					<l>into great perplexity of mind, and one day being exceedingly distress&apos;d about</l>
					<l>not comprehending what wou&apos;d become of us, that Text of </l>
					<l>Scripture darted so powerfully into my Mind I will be a Father</l>
					<l>to ye Fatherless &amp; a friend to ye Widow Ps 68.5 that I was comforted</l>
					<l>yea and all my needless concern was was directly dissipated believing at ye same</l>
					<l>time most positively that ye Lord changeth not, but what he saieth is yea</l>
					<l>and Amen In my 17<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year circumstances requir&apos;d <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>it</hi> that I chang&apos;d</l>
					<l>my place which was exceedingly alone when and I enter&apos;d into service in a</l>
					<l>farmers house in my own native place, which it was in this year that at the time when M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Ingham &amp; Mr Taylor came into these parts to preach ye Gosple, which being</l>
					<l>soon nois&apos;d about, I with many many more went out of curiosity to hear</l>
					<l>I see wherein these Preachers differ&apos;d from the generallity of other People, not</l>
					<l>understanding the meaning thereoff, but I was soon brought thereby to most</l>
					<l>serious and concern&apos;d reflections about my miserable and lost conditon by</l>
					<l>nature, which I saw &amp; feelt so plain that I was at once convinc&apos;d, that if Jesus.</l>
					<l>did not save me I was undone forever and tho&apos; I now believ&apos;d ye Minister&apos;s</l>
					<l>Testimony that Jesus came into ye world to bleed and die in order to save</l>
					<l>Sinners yet ye World and its vanity at times got the uper hand appearing</l>
					<l>to me in most butiful and lively Colours for as such I then thought them to be,</l>
					<l>and engag&apos;d my heart and mind so at times that they had certainly prov&apos;d Master</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>had not my kind Shepheard himself who had already Chosen me for his property him</l>
					<l>self became the Conquerer, for after spending thus far of my life in ignorance</l>
					<l>way with regard to ye happiness to be enjoy&apos;d in Christ Jesus, and a as a Sinner in</l>
					<l>sinfulness, I was under  M<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; subscript:true;'>r</hi> lngham&apos;s preaching on the words now then we are</l>
					<l>ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in</l>
					<l>Christ&apos;s stead, be ye reconciled to god Cor. v. 20 brought more particularly to ye (understand the) reality</l>
					<l>of the matter in myself, wanting no other peace and seeking none else and when as he repeated</l>
					<l>the words: Christ is reconciled to you, I pray&apos;d most sincerly to ye Lord to let me ex</l>
					<l>perience ye reallity of this grand truth in my heart with ye and I received the possitive assurance that I </l>
					<l>was excepted by him, and I went home with a deep sense of my fallen condition</l>
					<l>but at the same time rejoic&apos;d at ye preciousness of Salvation in Christ Jesus, which</l>
					<l>I believed to be attainted too, tho&apos; as yet I had not experience&apos;d it fully for myself, but</l>
					<l>was sincerely desirous after the same, and ye next day following ye Lord my God</l>
					<l>and Saviour made himself known to my heart, in that form wherein for all my</l>
					<l>need he underjustise rigor once on ye Cross didn&apos;t bleed. I shall not attempt to explain</l>
					<l>or describe, what I then felt and enjoy&apos;d, as this might only serve to marr what concerns</l>
					<l>the most important time of my life, from which time I date my happiness both in</l>
					<l>time and to unendless etternity, and as this is better understood by experience</l>
					<l>then explination, by every one who can say with me. Now no more I strive in vain</l>
					<l>Jesus Christ has wone my heart, First my thoughts and free from pain In his</l>
					<l>death. I have a part &amp;c. I shall say no more about this important period but that it was</l>
					<l>in my 18th year when I was in the greatest danger and feelt more of my depraved</l>
					<l>nature then at any other time in my Life, This put a stop to my running headlong into many</l>
					<l>foolish erro&apos;s which otherwise my natural inclinations wou&apos;d have led me to, but as I in</l>
					<l>some measure felt a liking for what I thought concerned not Christ I begun to under</l>
					<l>stand ye Lord&apos;s will was not mine will was not mine now and I frequently pray&apos;d to him since he had confered</l>
					<l>ye greatest of blessings upon me, in forgiving me my Sins also to make known his mind</l>
					<l>to me with regard to perticulars which were was a disturbance to me in my enjoyment of him</l>
					<l>and entierly to set me at liberty from all but everything that so I might have him alone, and as I found this requir&apos;d a</l>
					<l>true resignation to his will, this became a matter of concern with to me praying the Lord frequent</l>
					<l>to hear and help me, and since I knew I was his, I durst not do any thing of myself</l>
					<l>tho&apos; I often had the greatest inclination there to, but ye Lords hand was over me in a</l>
					<l>most particular manner, which I have been more sensible off since then at that time, and according</l>
					<l>to my petition so it was with me, for I soon found myself intierly set at liberty from everything all by</l>

					<l>my dear. Saviour understanding he had thoughts of peace over me, after which time</l>
					<l>I went on in an uninterrupted intercourse with him my best friend, who was become</l>
					<l>my dearest and nearest object in the midst of the World. I then join&apos;d M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Taylor&apos;s Society, but a disagreable circumstance happen&apos;d to him which was were the</l>
					<l>occasion of his leaving us, &amp; ye means of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ockerhousen&apos;s coming into these</l>
					<l>parts in order to settle a regular Society of which I was one &amp; frequented the preach</l>
					<l>ing at Duckenfield as often as possible, and in 1748 according to my request</l>
					<l>I went to live with ye S. S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> at Duckenfield to which I had a particular call</l>
					<l>in my heart from our dear Saviour, &amp; being quite clear in my call I spent</l>
					<l>my time chearful and happy. In ye year 1750 I came with 9 more S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>to live in Tiresall Oeconomy here in Yorkshire and during my stay there I was</l>
					<l>rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into ye Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; became Spectator of ye holy comunion which both was</l>
					<l>very weighty to me. In Dec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1752 I movd with some more to Fulneck</l>
					<l>in order to begin the Choir-house where I&apos;ve spent ye remainder part of my</l>
					<l>life. In april following I became partaker of ye holy Sacrament with this</l>
					<l>Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> which grace was rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> by me with a deep sencibility of my unworthiness</l>
					<l>which made me very timerous about myself Concerning the same but I was strengthened</l>
					<l>by my dear Saviours owning &amp; Comforting me thereby to my great a</l>
					<l>basement, so that thro&apos; his grace I have been enabled to partake thereoff every</l>
					<l>since when ever this Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> on our Choir has been privilidg&apos;d have been favored with the enjoyment</l>
					<l>thereof, to my real strength and help thro&apos; this vale of Tears: and my heart</l>
					<l>rejoices when ever its approach the time for it draweth nigh, and it was I to rehearse only</l>
					<l>some parts of the particulars of my course, relative to the internal matter since I came</l>
					<l>into this house it wou&apos;d at make the description of it too long, therefore, I shall leave it with only asking</l>
					<l>the following concerning what the Lord his done on my Soul. I sought him, &amp;</l>
					<l>found him, while he drew me with the cords of his love &amp; has overcome me so</l>
					<l>far that I am made one Spirit with him, never more to part to an endless</l>
					<l>Eternity what I have experience&apos;d in the enjoyment of him from time to time</l>
					<l>and how I have been instructed by his faithful Schooling in ye knowledge of</l>
					<l>my deep depravity &amp; nothingness, in stillness, will be matter of thanks &amp; praise with</l>

					<l>Martha Walker</l>
					<l>Our late dear Sister has in the above given a faith</l>
					<l>ful &amp; true account of her course thro&apos; time. She was</l>
					<l>an humble simple devoted Soul; &amp; counted it a privilege to </l>
					<l>serve our Savior whenever it was in her power. She</l>
					<l>has been 45 Years a very faithful Sickwaiter in</l>
					<l>the Single Sisters house here, during which time She</l>
					<l>has attended the 145 Sisters, who have departed to our</l>
					<l>Savior. In her office She was truly disinterested.</l>
					<l>impartial, tender to everyone, patient and loving;</l>
					<l>so that all both those who have departed under her care, &amp;</l>
					<l>who have recoverd, always spoke of her with the greatest</l>
					<l>regard, and her memory venerable among us.</l>
					<l>She remained in the Sickroom as long as she was</l>
					<l>able, till in this seven Months before her departure. She</l>
					<l>being troubled with a complaint in her leg, in which She </l>
					<l>sufferd much pain, she beged leave to retire from her </l>
					<l>office, &amp; she spent her time amidst all her suffering</l>
					<l>chearfully &amp; happily, in hopes of soon seeing her Savior.</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Her complaint towards the close of her life became</l>
					<l>still more extensive spread exceedingly; a mortifi</l>
					<l>cation having taken place. But amidst all, she was</l>
					<l>exceedingly patient, &amp; ardently longing to be at home</l>
					<l>with the Lord. One night, shortly before her end, She</l>
					<l>desired that her Choirhelper might be called; to whom</l>
					<l>when she came, she said, that she wished to tell</l>
					<l>her, how unspeakably happy she was, &amp; how near</l>
					<l>she felt our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, so that the could almost forget</l>
					<l>her bodily pain. In this happy state she continued</l>
					<l>till at pleased our Lord, on the 22<hi rend='superscript:true;'>nd</hi> of Jany to receive</l>
					<l>her redeemed Soul, which when * she fell gently &amp; hap</l>
					<l>pily asleep in the 75 66th Year of her age.</l>
					<l>* having rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> the blessing of her Choir</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and we must give her testimony that she lived in a near</l>
					<l>Connexion with our Savior, and knew herself as a Sinner</l>
					<l>often said She was the poorest Creature our Savior could</l>
					<l>have chosen, but was very thankful for her happy Lot</l>
					<l>of Grace, the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Sometimes wou&apos;d tell her how well She</l>
					<l>might have had it in the world, She always said what</l>
					<l>would that have been to me it I had never known my Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>he is of more worth to me than all this world can give.</l>
					<l>towards the latter end of her life She was very often Speaking</l>
					<l>of the goodness of our Savior as she frequlently had very</l>
					<l>bad rest in the Night she wou&apos;d say in the Morning how near our</l>
					<l>savior had heart to her, and that she cou&apos;d tell him every thing</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='7'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and that it was impossible to tell how kind he was to her</l>
					<l>he had never done her any thing but good on Our Last</l>
					<l>festival when She with the other sick S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> had her share</l>
					<l>of the Holy Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> brought to her, she was remarkably</l>
					<l>Cheerful and spoke afterwards of the grace she had enjoy&apos;d</l>
					<l>and how near our Savior had been to her, She had, had several</l>
					<l>bad nights but no one thought her end so near, or the 6 in</l>
					<l>the Night she was taken very Ill and in the Morning</l>
					<l>the Doctor went to see her who told her the wou&apos;d not live</l>
					<l>long, She was to delighted at the thought of it that She</l>
					<l>cou&apos;d not express her Joy, her Breath was so bad that She</l>
					<l>cou&apos;d not keep her bed but was oblig&apos;d to sit up day &amp; night</l>
