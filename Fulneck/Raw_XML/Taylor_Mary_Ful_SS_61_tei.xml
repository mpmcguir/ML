					<l>The Course of with of the S. Sister Mary Taylor who Departed</l>
					<l>to our Savior at Fulnec Feb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 21 1790</l>
					<l>I was Born at Moberly in the County of Cheshire July 11<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1745</l>
					<l>and Baptized in the Church of England. In my Childrens</l>
					<l>Years I felt some dawnings of Grace in my heart, but did know</l>
					<l>how to value it rightly. In my 10<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year my Father took me</l>
					<l>with Him to hear the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>, and I not a deep impression of our</l>
					<l>Saviors love in my heart, which remained with me for some</l>
					<l>Time. But in my 14<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year I began to see my lost Condition</l>
					<l>which soon brought me into dispair, and Satan got such</l>
					<l>power over me, that I believed there was no God, or if there</l>
					<l>was I had no right to Him &amp; I thought Hell its self could</l>
					<l>not contain more misery, than I found dwelt in me, so I</l>
					<l>wished I had never been Born, and that I had no immortale</l>
					<l>Soul to live forever; but Since I had, wish&apos;d that it might</l>
					<l>be distroyed, and not remain inthe number of those Souls</l>
					<l>that was immortal. This led me to think wether or no there</l>
					<l>was a God who had made me &amp; who cou&apos;d distroy my Soul: And</l>
					<l>I conclnded that there was a God, &amp; that he could save some that</l>
					<l>believed on Him. But I had no faith, and thought I must be</l>
					<l>lost. In this Situation I went to hear a Brother preach, the Text</l>
					<l>was at the Time of Ignorance God winketh at, but now</l>
					<l>Commandeth all Men every where to repent. I thought</l>
					<l>if I had but been Ignorant, then I might have hopes.</l>
					<l>but I have been told so often of our dear Savior, and what he</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>had done &amp; fuffered for poor Sinners, how often has my Father</l>
					<l>entreated me to go alone and to pray to my Maker &amp; Redeemer</l>
					<l>that He wood have mercy upon my Soul, but I had refulod it.</l>
					<l>All this was set before my heart &amp; Eyes in a clear light. But</l>
					<l>my distress I could tell to no one, and kept my misery to myself</l>
					<l>for I thought no one was as bad as I felt myself to be.</l>
					<l>In my 17<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year I went again to hear the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> preach</l>
					<l>and the Text was a great Comfort to my distressed Soul,</l>
					<l>It was the following He which hath begun a Good Work in</l>
					<l>you, will perform it untill the Day of Jesus Chriest, It</l>
					<l>was as if my dear Savior said to me, this is my work. Give</l>
					<l>thine Heart to me &amp; I will give the rest from thy Labour</l>
					<l>Oh how did my Soul rejoice that she Lord could have mercy</l>
					<l>upon me.  In the Year 1762 I moved with my Father</l>
					<l>&amp;  Mother to be near the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in Duckenfield, where I</l>
					<l>soon got a desire to live inthe Choirhouse, and Obtained</l>
					<l>leave in the Year following to my great Joy. But I must</l>
					<l>confess that I spent my Time there very indifferently &amp;</l>
					<l>did not seek in ernest to know my dear Saviors aim with me</l>
					<l>but was satisfied with some dawnings of his Grace.</l>
					<l>Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 23<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> 1763 I had the favor to be rec&apos;<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi></l>
					<l>from this Time I fell into a legal self working way</l>
					<l>striving in my own Spirit &amp; strength to become good, but</l>
					<l>in vain. Thus I spent 4 Years in this miserable self</l>
				</lg>

			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>righteous <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>working</hi> way of my own, Sometimes I was weany and</l>
					<l>tired out almost, but still could not leave it off. Till in</l>
					<l>the Year 1767, when I had the grace to become a Condidate</l>
					<l>for the Holy Comuinion. this gave me acdearer imight into</l>
					<l>myself than I had ever had before. I now found that all my</l>
					<l>self working was like a Cob web, &amp; all my self nighteousness</l>
					<l>was as felthy, &amp; that Verse was applicable to my condition.</l>
					<l>A Garment I myself had gained.</l>
					<l>A Staff I had whereon I lean&apos;d</l>
					<l>Which fell when tryed from out my hand</l>
					<l>My Robe I buent it to a brand.</l>
					<l>I had alonging desire to become a Partaker of the highest Good</l>
					<l>but was very timoaroay about it. However my dr Savior</l>
					<l>shewed me the way that as a poor Sinner I must go and</l>
					<l>venture upon his mercy. March the 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> 1760 on Maunday</l>
					<l>Thursday I partook for the first Time of the Highest Good</l>
					<l>in the Holy Sacrament, during which I got a deep impress.</l>
					<l>ion of our Saviours sufferings &amp; Death, &amp; it was a time</l>
					<l>of real Blessing to me which I hope never to forget; I went</l>
					<l>on in a still and happy Course for near a Year, when my Father</l>
					<l>&amp; Mother &amp; Brothers agreed to <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>force</hi> get me away from the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi></l>
					<l>by telling me that they were a deceitful People and that I</l>
					<l>was already deceived, but I could not believe them; but</l>
					<l>as their designs where frustrated, thay contrived a scheme</l>
					<l>to get meto my Father House by a message that if I would</l>
					<l>see my <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Father</hi> Mother alive I must come immeadsately</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>but it was <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>all</hi> entirely a Falshood &amp; deceit. &quot;I however went</l>
					<l>to see her I found her rather poorly but no ways danger-</l>
					<l>ously Ill, now sheirintentions was to keep me, and</l>
					<l>when I attempted to go back again, they would not suffer</l>
					<l>me to go &amp; when I set off they fetched me bact, and </l>
					<l>forced me to stay against my will &amp; at night locked</l>
					<l>me in my chamber, &amp; desired the neighbours to watch</l>
					<l>me least I should leave the House, this continued a whole</l>
					<l>week before I could make my escape. At last I found</l>
					<l>an Oppertunity to get off. on a Dark night, I went</l>
					<l>around about way for Duckenfield, that they might</l>
					<l>not ovortakeme if they pursued me. But my two</l>
					<l>Brothers &amp; two other Men, got to Duckenfield before</l>
					<l>me and placed them selves in the roads that led to the</l>
					<l>S S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House, so that I could not get home without meet</l>
					<l>ing some of them. my Brother happined to be in the</l>
					<l>road where I had to pass. He therefore stoped me and</l>
					<l>called the others to assist Him, they intended to take</l>
					<l>me back by force, but being near the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House, I cried </l>
					<l>as loud as I could, that they might hear me and come</l>
					<l>to my assistance, which they did, and came to see</l>
					<l>the reason of my cries, and one ofthem asked me if I</l>
					<l>would go back with the Men or not, I answered that</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>I would not return with them they then endeavoured to get</l>
					<l>me at liberty, but one of the Sisters was knocked down by</l>
					<l>one of them, which made them fight in good ernest,</l>
					<l>and the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> being almost come out, at length prevailed</l>
					<l>&amp; I escap&apos;d their hands, tho&apos; I was much bruis&apos;d <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>&amp;</hi></l>
					<l>by the hard usage I had undergone. I was thankful</l>
					<l>to my dear Savior, that I could be at rest again in my</l>
					<l>Choir House, but my Stay in Duckinfield was not long</l>
					<l>for I wrote to my Brother in Fulneck of what had</l>
					<l>happened to me, and He spoke to the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> there about</l>
					<l>me, <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>wishing</hi> thinking that it would be better if I re-</l>
					<l>moved to some other Congregation, this was taken into</l>
					<l>consideration, and I Obtained leave to live in Fulnec,</l>
					<l>accordingly on March the 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> 1769 I <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>went</hi> came to live in the</l>
					<l>Choir House here, where I was thankful to be, altho</l>
					<l>onulwardly I had it harder to procure a Maintenance</l>
					<l>than in Duckenfield, but I believe that the Lord will</l>
					<l>make it answer a good and at last. thus far her own</l>
					<l>Account.</l>
