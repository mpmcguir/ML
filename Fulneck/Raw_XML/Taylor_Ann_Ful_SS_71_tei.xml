					<l>of her, her unkle &amp; Aunt took to her, &amp; soon after her Mother</l>
					<l>dieing also she became entirely under of care of her Aunt</l>
					<l>who in ye year 40 was touch&apos;d in heart by our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> under ye</l>
					<l>preaching of M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ingham &amp; became a member of that Society,</l>
					<l>to w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> oppertunities she brought ye above child tho: at thatÂ </l>
					<l>time, much against her inclination, w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> was more for</l>
					<l>playing with other lightminded Children; this she has often</l>
					<l>since reflected on with concern, &amp; expressed her hearty thanks</l>
					<l>to our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; her aunt for their especial care of her at that</l>
					<l>time. In 45 B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Held haveing of care of ye Yorkshire Children</l>
					<l>&amp; she being admited to there meetings soon begun to love</l>
					<l>them &amp; to have a real tender feeling of her heart. In 46 her</l>
					<l>Aunt comeing to live in an oeconomy, a Sutable place was</l>
					<l>provided for her, where she stay&apos;d a year &amp; then left it of her</l>
					<l>own accord, w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> however gave her much Smart afterward.</l>

					<l>at Lambs Hill, &amp; notwithstanding thus favoured to live with</l>
					<l>Bre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> yet she co&apos;d not be satisfyed because she was not</l>
					<l>in ye Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; therefore beg&apos;d to be taken from that place</l>
					<l>thinking if she was but to live in an oeconomy with Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>that then she sho&apos;d soonner come to ye enjoyment of that</l>
					<l>happyness w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> she felt she wanted, to w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> priviledge, upon her</l>
					<l>earnest request Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Mary admited her vis: to Hightown, to live with two sisters</l>
					<l>where according to her expectation, she profited much, became solidly</l>

				<lg>
					<l>aquainted with our d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; her own poor heart, so that she gain&apos;d</l>
					<l>ye love of all her Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> &amp; enjoy&apos;d a real fellowship with them.</l>
					<l>May ye 13<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1745 she had ye Grace to become a member of ye Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> to</l>
					<l>her unspeakable consolation. and on ye 20, when ye oeconomy at </l>
					<l>little Gumersel was setled she had ye favour to be one of that happy</l>
					<l>company, of w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> she was very glad &amp; thankfull, remaining in that</l>
					<l>tender feeling for some time, but her impaticent longing for</l>
					<l>still farther Blessings, often caus&apos;d her pain &amp; w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> was renew&apos;d</l>
					<l>constantly when she Saw ye other Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> go to ye Lords Supper. of </l>
					<l>wch she spoak in a particular manner once to a Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, who</l>
					<l>asking her where she thought ye fault lay, answer&apos;d I don&apos;t</l>
					<l>know, being advised to make application to our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>for a right information, &amp; being asshur&apos;d by ye above Sister</l>
					<l>that she was not forgoten. she accordingly did so, &amp; very simply</l>
					<l>said I feel ye fault is all in my self, childlikly beging to</l>
					<l>be still thought on with regard to that matter, which was</l>
					<l>also done. And on ye 13th of July ye same year she had her</l>
					<l>longing desire satisfyed &amp; was made partaker of her Lords</l>
					<l>Corpse&apos;s &amp; blood in ye holy Sacrament, w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> proved a real &amp;</l>
					<l>lasting Blessing to her heart. But her natural dispossision</l>
					<l>being some what high, she depriv&apos;d her selfe of many happy</l>
					<l>hours w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> otherwise she might have enjoy&apos;d, &amp; this also gave</l>
					<l>occation of concern to those around her <hi rend='underlined:true;'>&amp; some painfull hours</hi></l>
					<l>But our D<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Lamb who know&apos;s all things, found out ways &amp;</l>
					<l>mean&apos;s whereby he cou&apos;d constantly bring her again to ye Sinner</l>
					<l>point, ye this made ye Sisters continue their love to her &amp;</l>
					<l>have paticence with her.</l>
					<l>dec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 56 she was leased with a sore cough atended with a pain</l>
					<l>in her side; by ye continuance of w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> it was judg&apos;d would</l>
					<l>prove a Consumption, tho she her selfe did not believe to</l>
					<l>if she was ask&apos;d at any time if she thought she sho&apos;d go home</l>
					<l>of this sickness, sho&apos;d answer no I can&apos;t believe I shall</l>
					<l>have that favour yet. But ye disorder encreasing, she came</l>

				<lg>
					<l>upon other thoughts, &amp; said that if she didnot onlter soon it</l>
					<l>would bring her to our Saviour, This made her often wish she </l>
					<l>might once go to live in ye Choir House &amp; there experience in a </l>
					<l>more particular manner her choir grace, w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ch</hi> favour however</l>
