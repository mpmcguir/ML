					<l>Septr the 5th 1764 Mary Scott a Single Women in Hallifax who</l>
					<l>was before her last sickness in no Connection with us went Hapily to our Savr</l>
					<l>she was born in the above mentiond Townin 1734; Her Parents being Church people</l>
					<l>Educated her in the same Way, her Mother was Concerned for her own Salvation;</l>
					<l>and when, Mr. Ingham preached several times in Hallifax Church, she</l>
					<l>went to hear him, as also afterwards the Brn; &amp; took this her Child alone</l>
					<l>with her, but afterwards she became Sick, &amp; went I Happily out of</l>
					<l>time in 1746 in relyance upon Jesus Merits. This her Daughter was</l>
					<l>then in her 13 Year, she Liv&apos;d all the rest of her time with her Father</l>
					<l>&amp; Kept House for him, as a Dutifull Obedient Child, but did not follow</l>
					<l>the Brn. any more After her Mothers departure, but went to Church &amp;</l>
					<l>led a Still &amp; quiet life, bore a good Character amongst all those that Knew</l>
					<l>her. About 2 Year ago she had the first Symtoms of a Consumption and</l>
					<l>Dropsy, but was restored again by timely Assistance; However a Troublesome</l>
					<l>Cough &amp; Shortness of Breath attended her ever After, she came during that time</l>
					<l>now &amp; then to the Stanery to hear the Brn which always left on impression</l>
					<l>upon her mind, however she being inclin&apos;d to be good, the Convictions to Seek</l>
					<l>forgiveness of Sins in our Savr &amp; his Bloody Visits remained a Mistery to</l>
					<l>Her. About Christmass last past her Cough increased to a great degree &amp;</l>
					<l>the Dropsial Symtoms Appeared low again, this she went on to the</l>
					<l>latter end of February, when she disired one of our Single Srs: to tell the</l>
					<l>Br: who comes to the Stanery to come to see her, &amp; Br. Schulze who has the</l>
					<l>care of that plan at present went on February the 28th to see her the first</l>
					<l>time, when she told him her great concern to be saved with many Tears</l>
					<l>and he painted the Friend of Sinners as Crucified to her heart, which had</l>
					<l>also its wished for Effect, for she soon Observed that all her former Piety</l>
					<l>availed nothing, which gave her great pain. About a fortNight after</l>
					<l>it was made clear to her that all selfmade Piety was an Abomination to</l>
					<l>our Saviour, &amp; she ventur&apos;d as one who all her Life time had endeavoured to</l>
					<l>establish a Rightiousness of her own, as a Sinner to our Saviour, &amp; He</l>
					<l>as the Sinners Friend drew near her Heart, which gave her great Comfort</l>
					<l>&amp; has never left her during her long &amp; painfull Sickness. Br. Schulze</l>
					<l>recomended her to the Single Srs who live at Stanery, &amp; they have</l>
					<l>visited her partly every Day to her great Comfort. Sr: Whitehead &amp; some</l>
					<l>other Sisters from Wike have also several times gone to Visit her.</l>
					<l>Sr May &amp; Ann Birkby who Visited this plan visited her likewise on</l>
					<l>June the 18th to their Satisfaction, just then her Dropsy being at Height</l>
					<l>&amp; she was Swell&apos;d to a High degree. She has been Oblidg&apos;d to sit up</l>

					<l>&amp; has not been in Bed since Mid-Sumer Day, but has indured every</l>
					<l>thing with such Uncomon Patience, that it Struk even Natural People with</l>
					<l>Amase, to see her so chearfull &amp; Childlike amidst those incredible pains she</l>
					<l>indured, which became at last so Troublesome that she had no rest our Sleep</l>
					<l>for near a Week togather, &amp; when ever she must be moved or Lifted at any</l>
					<l>time, she could not forbear Crying out like one that is pierced thro.</l>
					<l>When ever she was overcome with impatience, she Wept soon After</l>
					<l>Ask&apos;d pardon of those about her &amp; Called herself a Coward, because she</l>
					<l>did not bear more Childlikely, what our Saviour was pleas&apos;d to let her,</l>
					<l>indure.  I continued Visiting her for these 27 Weeks every Tuesday</l>
					<l>but one, with real Satisfaction; &amp; found her Heart always Tender,</l>
					<l>Towards our Saviour, never did I visit any one more glad &amp; Thank</l>
					<l>full then she was every time, amidst her Pitefull &amp; Painfull Sickness,</l>
					<l>She being poor, our Saviour raised up Friends who assisted her in all</l>
					<l>she stood in deed off; and among the rest a Young Women, who has proved</l>
					<l>a Friend indeed: One Grace Holdin who was aquainted with her from</l>
					<l>a Child, who has spent most of her time with her &amp; Nurs&apos;d her to theÂ </l>
					<l>best of her Knowledge &amp; when even her Dropsy broke &amp; became</l>
					<l>disagreeable she has either Dress&apos;d &amp; Kept her clean herself, or procur&apos;d</l>
					<l>some Body to do it for her. however by seing Mary Carried on in such</l>
					<l>a manner &amp; hearing me Speak with her has likewise get a concern</l>
					<l>for her Souls Salvation, &amp; has come to meetings to the Stanery &amp; disires</l>
					<l>to be recieved into the Society. When I saw poor Mary the Tuesday before</l>
					<l>last her feet Mortifying &amp; her Body full of exquisite pain, it moved</l>
					<l>my heart with such pityy &amp; Compassion, that I could not Speak a word</l>
					<l>for some time for altho she was Dress&apos;d twice a Day her Feet which had</l>
					<l>great holes, began to be so bad that a Kind of Grups grew in it &amp; fell</l>
					<l>out of the holes, but this did not last longer then 2 or 3 Days, I visited</l>
					<l>her the last time on Septr. the 4th I Kept her a Liturgy with great</l>
					<l>Tenderness, &amp; prayed our Saviour to hasten her dissolution &amp; take her soon</l>
					<l>out of this bodily pain, which also came to pass the Day Following about</l>
					<l>9 o&apos;Clock in the fornoone, when first the one arm became lifeless &amp;</l>
					<l>then that whole side she sinking togather disired to be raised up, &amp; said</l>
					<l>soon After now my dear Lamb is acoming for me, which were her last</l>
					<l>words, &amp; soon after she fall happily asleep in the 30 year of her age</l>
					<l>she is now in Peace.</l>
