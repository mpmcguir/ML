					<l>I was Born in the town of Mirfield in Yorkshir in the year 1735</l>
					<l>on the 29 of Sept, my parents belonging the Church of Ingland In my</l>
					<l>young years, begun to be Consarned about My Salvation &amp; was affraid</l>
					<l>of doing of saying any thing which would Displeas God for fear I Might</l>
					<l>not be saved one Night when I was about 6 years old I dreamt our</l>
					<l>Sav came into the Room were I was, as soon at I saw him got up &amp; ran</l>
					<l>to him &amp; pray&apos;d him to Bless me which he did &amp; I thought he Showd</l>
					<l>me a well in the side of the room In the which he said I Should be</l>
					<l>dipped of then I should be his it had such an Imprection on me</l>
					<l>that I never forgot it when the Brethen came to preach at foxwood</l>
					<l>I went with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them In some time after</l>
					<l>Bro Helt came to have the Care of the Children so he told us as Many</l>
					<l>us had a mind to be our Saviours Should wright a few lines to him</l>
					<l>which I did also his Meetings was peculery Blest to my heart &amp;</l>
					<l>When he told us of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> becoming Man and that he he was</l>
					<l>crusyfyed of had Recved So many wounds for as to perchase our Salvation</l>
					<l>I was very much lade hold on &amp; I wept Many times, as I grew older I</l>
					<l>??? to to be put in here</l>
					<l>felt my Corruption more &amp; more which made me very heavy and</l>
					<l>glomy I thought Shurly there is not one that is So Spoiled &amp; So</l>
					<l>full of evel as I am, but the Convictions which felt I never went</l>
					<l>In no Gross sins yet I felt a love for Sin &amp; begun a self working</l>
					<l>a striving to become better, the More I Strove against it the</l>
					<l>worse I grew I often took Lonely walks were I might have my thoughts</l>
					<l>to myself &amp; allso pour out my Sighs to the Lord, evry thing I saw</l>
					<l>Increased my sorow they looked So happy &amp; evry thing answered</l>
					<l>the end for what they was formed for but as for me I lothed</l>
					<l>myself feeling Nought but Sin, I frequeuted the Meetings</l>
					<l>very Constant, I felt as if I was going to be juged for evry Word</l>
					<l>As the Bro spoke I tried my own Heart by it to feell if I</l>
					<l>Could get any hopes that our Sav would have Mercy on such a</l>
					<l>Rech as I am, when the Sisters came to Visit me Sis Lesel and</l>
					<l>Eunes Brook being Sisters that had a pecular Confidence to I</l>
					<l>felt a grate freedom to tell them my whole Heart as well as ever</l>
					<l>I Could in hopes that they Could Gess weather I should come thro or no</l>
					<l>they allways Comforted me &amp; told me it was a Grace that our Sav</l>
					<l>Let me feell what I was by nature &amp; allso that it was just such that</l>
					<l>our Sav came to save, but I being of a reasoning turn it seemed</l>
					<l>to be made to very esey &amp; except I felt our Savs Nearness so clear as</l>
					<l>&amp; I allmost saw him I dare not beleve &amp; so Long as I have not this</l>
					<l>Grace I will not have no other Comfort that is to be assured of the</l>
					<l>forgivness of all my Sins, so I went on fo some time struggling</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>strugling with my Lods as a silly child for if I had a more Simple Heart</l>
					<l>I know I Might have found rest sooner, but my dear Sav whose Care</l>
					<l>I have been Shure of from a littell Child did not for all my unbeleve</l>
					<l>&amp; hardness of Heart did not leave his poor Child but followed me with</l>
					<l>Unweared patience tell he Could his ame fullfill so I went on till</l>
					<l>my 17 year when I begun to be tired of all my own attempts &amp; to See</l>
					<l>clearly I Could do Nothing of myself, so I thought if I perish it shall</l>
					<l>be at My Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> feet, but one day when I was praying by myself I broke</l>
					<l>out in these words I am a Sinner this I know all in me deserving wo</l>
					<l>but Sence thou has dyed for me my Lamb I pray thee take me as I</l>
					<l>am, I had no Sooner giving myself into the Hands of my Sav, to live</l>
					<l>but my dearist Bridgroom manifested himself so clear before my</l>
					<l>Heart &amp; eys with all his wounds that I was quite overcome with his</l>
					<l>Beauty I felt that he had forgave me all my Sins &amp; the Lods I had</l>
					<l>Carried was quite gorn O how I felt I shall never forget my Heart</l>
					<l>was so Captivated with my Bloody Freind that he was become my</l>
					<l>Cheff Object O I cannot express the part what peace &amp; life my poor</l>
					<l>heart Injoyed for I can say with truth when in his Blood I saw him</l>
					<l>Swim a small drop I did get which glued me to him, him to me the</l>
					<l>First time that we meet, I began to think I Could like very Much</l>
					<l>to be in the Congregation tho, I felt myself very unworthy of that grace</l>
					<l>but I spoke with our Sav about it often, but leaving it at the Same time</l>
					<l>to his will for I was affrade of myself not answering the end, I never</l>
					<l>told my Cosarn to my Labours for I thought if our Saviour thinks</l>
					<l>good I Shall be Reced he will put it into the Bre &amp; Sis, hearts when it</l>
					<l>is the wright time, when I came to Fulneck my Labour told me I might</l>
					<l>wright to the Congrea, which was very welcome to me so I did &amp; Brought it to</l>
					<l>my labour, and in the year 1752 on the 13 of Nov I had the Grace to be</l>
					<l>Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ed</hi> into the dear Cong, of which I felt myself very unworthy of but</l>
					<l>I gave myself up to our dear Sav &amp; wished to be a joy to him &amp; to his pepel</l>
					<l>soon after I had the unexpected news that I had leave to come in the Choir</l>
					<l>House which Suprised me; I allways had a pecular mind to be in the Choir</l>
					<l>house or Econemy but I thought it to grate a Grace for poor me, as soon as</l>
					<l>my parents Could get my things ready I came which was on the 3 of Feb</l>
					<l>1753 when I got my long wished for Desire granted to live in the Choir</l>
					<l>House were I lived a grate Girl tell the Mounth of Aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> the Singell</l>

					<l>Blessing from our Saviour in it but as it was his will I devoted myself to</l>
					<l>by dearist Bridegroom &amp; wished to become a true virgin Both in</l>
					<l>Soul &amp; Body to be intirely to his Heart in all things, in the year 1753</l>

					<l>feell what a poor Child I was and would not let me be Sattifyed if I had Severd</l>
					<l>from him in any thing till I felt his Forgiveness, in May 1761 I  was made</l>
