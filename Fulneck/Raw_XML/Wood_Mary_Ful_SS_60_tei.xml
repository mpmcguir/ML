					<l>I was Born in Gloslop Parish near Hayfeld in Darbisher Aprell</l>
					<l>ye 6 1729 My Parints being Church pepell &amp; endevered to being us up</l>
					<l>for the Lord and endeverd to keep us from worly Company as far as they</l>
					<l>Could, My Mother ust often tell us of our Sav, at the time when I got the Smallpox</l>
					<l>I was so ill that I was given up by the Doctor my father asked me if I could</l>
					<l>Like to go to our Sav I Sade yes for I felt Somthing of our Savs love in my</l>
					<l>Heart, but I soon recovered again, In the year 1732 David Talor Came</l>
					<l>about a preaching My Father and mother went to hear him &amp; took me</l>
					<l>with them which I liked soon after M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Inrom came his preaching I liked</l>
					<l>Still better for I now felt that I wanted somthing for my Heart, In a short</l>
					<l>time after ye Brethen came and Settell a Laity at our House which gave us</l>
					<l>an oppertunity to speak to them about our Hearts which often proved a Comfort</l>
					<l>and Consolation to me at that time, in ye year 1736 I Came the first time to</l>
					<l>Yorkhir I had the pleasur of geting Acquainted with Some of ye Sisters they took</l>
					<l>me to the econimy in pudsy for a few Days were I had some Conversation with</l>
					<l>Ann Burkbe &amp; Sis Clacket the latter asked me if I was Resolved to be our Sav &amp;</l>
					<l>live for him I told her that it was my whole intention so to do She spoke to me of</l>
					<l>our Sav, love to poor Sinners which made a deep impression on my heart</l>
					<l>the fellowship which I injoyed with ye Sisters &amp; Blessed feeling I had of the place</l>
					<l>made me think that Lambshill was a heaven upon earth which Caused me much</l>
					<l>pain to Leave it, Some day after I got to my father I begun to grow more and</l>
					<l>more unesy &amp; distress in my mind I ust to go by myself into the feld and prayed</l>
					<l>our Sav, that he would let me feell his Grace as I found that I had no lasting</l>
					<l>satisfaction in any thing but our Sav was pleased to draw nigh to my Heart which</l>
					<l>proved a real comfort to me thus I went on for Some time in a Chearfull</l>
					<l>way being our Sav to preserve me from day to day for I felt that in myself I was</l>
					<l>a poor and good for nothing Creater, when Bro &amp; Sis Heakerwelder Came to</l>
					<l>Care for the plan in Duckinfeild I gained much Confidence to them both &amp;</l>
					<l>Could Acquaint them with every thing which opprest my mind, in ye year 1748 our Sav</l>
					<l>was pleased to Call my Mother to himself which went very near me for I loved</l>
					<l>her exceedingly she comforted us in the Best Manner and Assured us that our</l>
					<l>Sav and his dear Congreation would know Better how to Care for us then She had</l>
					<l>done her last words were I am quite Ready to go to my dearist Bridegroom</l>
					<l>which had a very Blessed effect on my Mind from this time on I felt a real</l>
					<l>Desire in my heart to become a member of the Congreation in ye year 50 on</l>
					<l>ye 13 of June our Sav granted me my Requste to be Reciveed which unexpected</l>
					<l>Grace and faviour bowed me in the dust at the feet of my Dearist Bridegroom</l>
					<l>In the same year I was made a Candiate for the holy Sacreament and was</l>
					<l>confirmed at Christmas which Grace I cannot express in words but my being</l>
					<l>So far a distance from the Congreation delayed my going to the Communing for</l>
					<l>Sometime Longer it however brought me into a Close and Strick exsamanation</l>
					<l>in my own heart and one Day as I was walking alone by myself in the feilds</l>
					<l>Medeatating what a grate matter it was to go to the holy Sacreament and that no</l>
					<l>one Could Injoy it right but such as Could know that there Sins was</l>

					<l>Forgiven them by our Sav and thou Hearts washed in his Blood, but I</l>
					<l>found that it was not so with me it brought me into great perplexity of</l>
					<l>mine which I strove to hide from my Father &amp; Sis, I felt a great inclination</l>
					<l>to be allways by myself Sometimes thoughts would arise in my Mind as if</l>
					<l>our Sav did not like to have any thing to do with me; my Misry daly increased</l>
					<l>so that I thought that I Should never come thro feeling very much destress</l>
					<l>In my Soul I retired into a room were I prostrated and prayed our dear</l>
					<l>Saviour that he would be pleased to Manifest himself to my poor Heart</l>
					<l>in that figure were in for all my Need he did die on the Cross for poor me</l>
					<l>I was Cheared &amp; Comforted by the greatious Absolutison which I Recved as a</l>
					<l>poor pardon Sinner which Melted me like wax before my only Machless</l>
					<l>Heart whose thro bored feet I kiss and weted with many a thankfull Tear</l>
					<l>beging that he would keep me as a poor Child that had no dependance but</l>
					<l>on him alone in ye year 1751 Aprell 16 I had the unspeakabell</l>
					<l>Grace and faviour to pertake for the First time of our Sav Corps &amp;</l>
					<l>Blood in the holy Commuion which day I Shall never forget it was</l>
					<l>to me as if our Sav was Bodly present in the Congreation, I retured</l>
					<l>home again with a Heart throly thankfull for what I had injoyed</l>
					<l>But being Convinced in my own heart that I was not as yet in that pleace</l>
					<l>which our Sav had called me too My desive to live with the Sis grew more &amp;</l>
					<l>more stronge and after Coming again to Yorkshir I Spoke to Sis Mary about</l>
					<l>Coming to live with the Sisters in the econimy but she desired me to be</l>
					<l>Sattisfyed till Surcumstance would make it so that and My Sis Ester Could</l>
					<l>Both Could Come at a time and assured me that we should not be unforgoten</l>
					<l>but Cared for as well as if we lived amongst them, in the same year it was</l>
					<l>thought well by the Brethen for my father to be Married again which gave</l>
					<l>me and My Sis some hope of our going to live at lambshill, we Both made</l>
					<l>our desire known to Sis Mary in wrighten and got leave to Come as soon as</l>
					<l>we Could make it possabell in ye year 1752 in September the long wished for</l>
					<l>time came when Both I and My Sis came to live with the Sisters in the</l>
					<l>Econimy were we was Reced amongst them with much love which put us</l>
					<l>quite to Shame Sis Mary acquainted me that my Sis would stay in the ecominy</l>
					<l>at lambshill and for me to go to that ecominy at the tiersellhall which I felt to</l>
					<l>be quite sattifed with I soon found myself at home amongst them and</l>
					<l>injoyed much Grace and happiness in that place when the quire house</l>
					<l>was Finished I amonget the rest got leave to move into it which I</l>
					<l>esteemed a grate Grace and faviour for which I could never be thankfull</l>
					<l>Enofe to our dear Sav for I beged My dearist Bridegroom very tenderly</l>
					<l>that he world make me a obbedent good Child according to his heart and</l>
					<l>mind So that he could obtain his full aime with me in every respect for I</l>

					<l>everyday what poor Creater I was in myself and in how much need I stood of our</l>
					<l>Sav reaching in my heart being Masterly of a Close dispositson and unremovable</l>
					<l>In my own way of thinking and lacking the occation that the Sister was after obblige</l>
					<l>to reprove me which I did not take well of them alltho I Spoke as littell against it</l>
					<l>as posiabell yet in my heart I had not that true Sinnerlike feeling which I</l>
					<l>beleved that the rest of my Sisters did injoy and on account of this I felt often</l>
					<l>unesy and keept many a hearty Band with my Best beloved friend which was</l>
					<l>pleased to Show me my falts by Name and comforted me about it in a unspea</l>
					<l>kabell Mannar </l>
					<l>I soon began to grow Sickly got a pain in my Side and by a Rumactket dissoder in my Back</l>
					<l>was rended in some Measure unabell for my work which Caused a Certain</l>
					<l>Fretfullness in my mind all posiabell means was used to get me some help</l>
					<l>yet to very lettell efect Sis Mary advised me to go for a short time home to my</l>
					<l>Father to see if the Change of the air would do me good but after a true</l>
					<l>consideration about it I found no liberty in my heart for it I therefore beged</l>
					<l>to be excuse as I had the assurance from our Sav that I was in the right pleace</l>
					<l>which he had alloted for me I did address myself to the freind of poor needy</l>
					<l>Sinners and prayed him to stand by me and help me thro tell he had prepared me</l>
					<l>for himself in ye year 1753 when Anna Jona pade a viset in Yorkshire She</l>
					<l>Spoke to all the Sisters and I had likewise had the Sattifaction to keep a hearty Band with</l>
					<l>her which proved a grate Blessing for my heart, in the year 1754 to we had the pleasure</l>
					<l>and satifaction to see our dear Papar &amp; Mamaen amongst we which happy and Blessed</l>
					<l>time will never be forgoten by me and what I felt and injoyed at that cause most memorabell</l>
					<l>Choir Sacrament and foot washing, cant express in Words O how was I struck when was made</l>
					<l>acquainted that I was to be one of that number I could hardly contain for Shame</l>
					<l>and thankfullness to think that our Sav Should Chuse me one of the poorist and the </l>
					<l>unworthist of them all I devoted myself anew to the Bridegroom of my Soul to live for</l>
					<l>him in this world and I will kiss his bored Feet in Eternity for all what I</l>
					<l>have injoyed from him when I look back and consider the Manifold Graces and</l>
					<l>Blessings which he has been pleased to bestow on me the poorist of all and yea what</l>
					<l>Love and patiance he has shown to his poor helpless Child it bows me in the dust with</l>
					<l>a heart full of Gratitude and my whole wish is to keep my eye fixt upon his Marterd</l>
					<l>Pirson so that nothing May come betwen him and me. So far her own words</l>
					<l>Our haply Departed Sis was In Ganrall of a still &amp; quiet disposion one</l>
