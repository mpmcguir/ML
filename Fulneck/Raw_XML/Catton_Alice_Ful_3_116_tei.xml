					<l>died Feb. / 48</l>
					<l>Our late Sr Alice Catton was</l>
					<l>bore at Hathwaite in Huddersf<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in</l>
					<l>Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1767, her parents being in</l>
					<l>connection with the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> church &amp; mem</l>
					<l>bers of our Cog<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> at Mifield who enjoyed</l>
					<l>the Grace of God in their hts. &amp; bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> up their</l>
					<l>childr<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in the nuture &amp; admonit<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of ye Ld so</l>
					<l>that our late S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> knew the truth &amp; doubtless</l>
					<l>felt powerful drawings of divine lore from</l>
					<l>her early childhood. When ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> 16 yrs of age,</l>
					<l>she came to reside in it sisters house at</l>
					<l>that time existing at Littlemoor in the</l>
					<l>house now tenanted by M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Parkinson While</l>
					<l>there she grew in grace &amp; in the knowledge</l>
					<l>of our Ld. &amp; Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Jes. Christ, as her occasional</l>
					<l>references in conversation, to that period</l>
					<l>of her life, as a happy &amp; profitable one, proved.</l>
					<l>In the y<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1783 the establishme<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> at Littlemoor</l>
					<l>being broken up, she removed with most of</l>
					<l>her companions to our Sisters house here</l>
					<l>having spent 8 years in the other institu</l>
					<l>tion, &amp; having been, during that time, rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi></l>
					<l>into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; admitted to the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. She</l>
					<l>did not spend reside (in this Sisters&apos; house) for</l>
					<l>the whole of her remaining time, but lived</l>
					<l>some years with her late father, nursing him</l>
					<l>faithfully until his end, in her native place</l>
					<l>she was also a short time at Gumersal - lived with</l>
					<l>a friend in a private house in Fulneck</l>
					<l>&amp; likewise occupied another house by herself</l>
					<l>she was for sometime cook in the Sisters</l>
					<l>house, &amp; spent attasctory upwards of 50</l>
					<l>years either in this or that at Littlemoor.</l>
					<l>The fact, that throughout the whole of her</l>
					<l>lengthened pilgrimmage of 4 score years she</l>
					<l>maintained a consistent Moravian character</l>
					<l>proves that she knew whom she believed,</l>
					<l>that her love of Moravians constrained her, &amp; that</l>
					<l>she walked humbly with her God. Tho&apos; not</l>
					<l>so communicative &amp; open as some followers</l>
					<l>of the Lamb on spiritual subjects, her</l>

				<lg>
					<l>&amp; tender, as well as her walk conformable to</l>
					<l>the gospel, showed that she was in Christ &amp; that</l>
					<l>his spirit dwelt in her. Being, moreover of</l>
					<l>a very cheerful, lively &amp; amiable disposition</l>
					<l>she was generally beloved &amp; respected wherever</l>
					<l>she dwelt &amp; by old &amp; young. Her course</l>
					<l>temporal &amp; spiritual, was remarkably</l>
					<l>smooth &amp; even; she had an excellent con</l>
					<l>stitut<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; enjoyed very good health not</l>
					<l>feeling much even of the infirmities of</l>
					<l>old age &amp; being able often to attend the means</l>
					<l>of grace in which she delighted finding in</l>
					<l>these pastures for her soul. Nor had she</l>
					<l>many trials, of an external nature, to</l>
					<l>cope with; perhaps the heaviest was the loss</l>
					<l>of her little property by the failure of a</l>
					<l>bank in Halifax, at a time when such</l>
					<l>a calamity must be peculiarly dis</l>
					<l>tressing viz. where old-age was approaching</l>
					<l>yet she submitted, taking the dispensation</l>
					<l>as from the hands of the Lord, &amp; believing that</l>
					<l>he would know how to provide for her; nor</l>
					<l>was her confidence put to shame; he, who </l>
					<l>clothes the lilies &amp; feeds the ravens, found</l>
					<l>her food &amp; raiment &amp; what adds so much</l>
					<l>to those blessings a contented &amp; cheerful mind</l>
					<l>until he took her to where the Lamb himself</l>
					<l>shall feed his sheep &amp; guide them to living</l>
					<l>fountains of water. She was attacked</l>
					<l>by the then prevailing influenza ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 2</l>
					<l>mo<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> ago, &amp; was so much reduced, that she</l>
					<l>quite expected to be called home to her</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>; she recovered, however, once more so</l>
					<l>for, as to have almost regained her wanted</l>
					<l>strength; but on Friday Jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> she</l>
					<l>was taken ill of another complaint, which</l>
					<l>presently reduced her so rapidly, that no</l>
					<l>hopes could be entertained of her recovery. </l>
					<l>Throughout the whole of her illness she was</l>
					<l>much pleased to enter into spiritual con</l>
					<l>versat<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> with any spiritual believing friend, always</l>
					<l>welcomed her labourer &amp; her minister, </l>
					<l>whom she had known from a little Boy, with</l>
					<l>joy &amp; affection &amp; loved to have a prayer offered.</l>

					<l>ed up at her side. When it became</l>
					<l>evident, that her days were numbered , &amp;</l>
					<l>she was asked, if she herself tho<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>would at this time take her to himself,</l>
					<l>she said at first with the utmost calm</l>
					<l>ness, &quot;It is not yet clear to me,&quot; but after</l>
					<l>a day or two, she said decidedly, &quot;I know</l>
					<l>not that I <hi rend='underlined:true;'>am</hi> going,&quot; adding that she</l>
					<l>knew her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, in whom she had so long be</l>
					<l>lieved, who had led her from her youth</l>
					<l>up &amp; shewn her never varying loving</l>
					<l>kindness, could now complete His work</l>
					<l>&amp; crown His Grace for that tho&apos; she was</l>
					<l>a poor worthless sinner in herself, He had</l>
					<l>washed her from sins in his own blood</l>
					<l>&amp; would, she assuredly believed, fully pre</l>
					<l>pare her, by His spirit for entering into</l>
					<l>his kingdom &amp; seeing Him face to face.</l>
					<l>She spoke with true humility of herself</l>
					<l>as of one who had not a crumb of merit</l>
					<l>no, not <hi rend='underlined:true;'>one</hi> righteous work to plead;</l>
					<l>but she extolled the all sufficiency, the</l>
					<l>grace, the tender loving kindness of her</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> as her <hi rend='underlined:true;'>All</hi>. A friend observing to her</l>
					<l>one day in conversation, &quot;You have</l>
					<l>had a smooth &amp; even course thro&apos; time,&quot;</l>
					<l>she replied: &quot;Indeed I have, tho&apos; not quite</l>
					<l>without troubles, which we must all</l>
					<l>share, I have indeed been most justly</l>
					<l>led, even to heavy heirs. Her very looks</l>
					<l>beamed for the the calm serenity of her</l>
					<l>soul, &amp; whenever she was asked if</l>
					<l>she still felt our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> peace in her</l>
					<l>soul, &amp; felt her reply was an empha</l>
					<l>tic &quot;Yes!&quot; she stated too, that no doubts</l>
					<l>or fears even of a transiently disturbed her</l>
					<l>peace &amp; joy in believing. Up to last sa</l>
					<l>turday, tho&apos; occasionally rambling she</l>
					<l>was able to understand &amp; answer ques</l>
					<l>tions, but on Lords day morning all con</l>

					<l>sciousness seemed to be gone &amp; she</l>
					<l>lay perfectly quiet till ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> 6 o&apos;clock</l>
					<l>in the evening when she breathed her</l>
					<l>last in the most gentle manner, &amp;</l>
					<l>without even a sigh, at the age of 80</l>
					<l>years &amp; about 10 weeks. Thus her last</l>
					<l>end was peace, &amp; she sleeps in Jesus.</l>
