					<l>The Course of life of the Single Sister Sarah Metcalf</l>
					<l>I was born at Southowram feb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. 16 1708 &amp; Baptzd in </l>
					<l>the Church of England, &amp; many drawings of Grace </l>
					<l>was perceptable to me in my Childrens years which</l>
					<l>I made use of <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>by</hi> in the dutys of the Church in hopes</l>
					<l>of pleasing God, to the Saving of my Soul from</l>
					<l>Eternal Distruction, &amp; as I grew in years I beleived</l>
					<l>myself in such a State of happiness prefable to my</l>
					<l>dear mother that I became so concerned about her Salv.</l>
					<l>that I cou&apos;d have no heaven in Eternity without Her</l>
					<l>tho&apos; I had no knowledge of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> or that there was</l>
					<l>any other Salvation then what was founded on a</l>
					<l>religious Life &amp; conversation - &amp; perceived a real</l>
					<l>Enmitie in my heart to any one that thought themselves</l>
					<l>better then myself, yet at the same time felt many</l>
					<l>Emotions in me after the evil &amp; vanities of the world</l>
					<l>&amp; plainly perceived that my pious course of Life was</l>
					<l>&amp; continual dissappointment to me to the working</l>
					<l>up wrath &amp; disscontentment, &amp; when my B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> told me that</l>
					<l>my Sister had experience the forgiveness of Her Sins</l>
					<l>in the bitterness of my Soul said it was all falseness &amp;</l>
					<l>delution for there was no such thing to be attaind, my</l>
					<l>necessities of heart brought me to frequent the Meetings</l>
					<l>kept by the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> at Smithhouse &amp; also at my fathers</l>
					<l>yet a midst all this I lik&apos;d not to venture upon any</l>

					<l>then my own works &amp; selfrighteous &amp; quotation from</l>
					<l>the Scripture for my walk &amp; conversation yet my heart remaind as hard as Stone</l>
					<l>&amp; I found it a perplexing Circumstance to my Mind</l>
					<l>when ever I thought of being separated from my mother</l>
					<l>Either in Time or in Etermity &amp; continued to live with my parents</l>
					<l>till they both departed out of time which to the best</l>
					<l>of my remembrance was about my 35 years.</l>
					<l>I apply myself closely to the preachings Especially those</l>
					<l>kept by Br Spaningburg which prov&apos;d a great</l>
					<l>blessing to me I was also look into bands &amp; Class as</l>
					<l>amongest the Single Sisters, &amp; a midst all carry<hi rend='superscript:true;'>&apos;d</hi> Many</l>
					<l>disstressing Conviction of my lost condition particularly</l>
					<l>at my Spinning one day I was Sized with such Terrors</l>
					<l>of Hell &amp; damnation that I saw myself in a Much</l>
					<l>worst situation Then Judas, who betray&apos;d the Lord</l>
					<l>of Life &amp; Glory, those terrors was succeedd by a</l>
					<l>comfortable asshurence that my Crucified Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> had</l>
					<l>died for all my Sins, the cherefulness of heart</l>
					<l>which I now enjoyed sweetend all the Labour of my</l>
					<l>attendance of my sick Brother who thro Lameness had been some</l>
					<l>years confined unto his bed, &amp; as I was one day going</l>
					<l>to fulneck to the Meeting, I open meself a verse as following</l>
					<l>oh Church of God redeemd Bride, believe it &amp; thereby abide</l>
					<l>this strength<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> &amp; refreshs my heart so as If a Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Covenantd</l>
