					<l>The Life of the mar<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi>. Sr Ann stead who departed</l>
					<l>to her Redeemer June 13<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1772</l>
					<l>The herself dictated the following to her Husband.</l>
					<l>I was born at Bradford March 28<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1730 &amp; educated in the</l>
					<l>Church of England. I grew up in a very careless manner</l>
					<l>having no particular thoughts or Concern about my Salva</l>
					<l>tion. In the Year 1750 I was married to my present</l>
					<l>Husband who belonged to the Brethren&apos;s Society, but being</l>
					<l>gay &amp; liking the world &amp; the ways thereof, I was much</l>
					<l>against his going to the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> Meetings, which occasioned</l>
					<l>him to speak very seriously tho tenderly with me when he told me</l>
					<l>his Reasons for going among the Brethren, &amp; that he for him,</l>
					<l>self was determined to continue his Connexion with them</l>
					<l>&amp; adhere to the Doctrine he had heard of them, but would</l>
					<l>give me full liberty to go to divine Service.</l>
					<l>whenever I chose. I was not satisfied long to go a dif</l>
					<l>ferent way to my husband, &amp; moreover seeing something</l>
					<l>more in him than I saw in myself &amp; many others I was</l>
					<l>drawn to go with him. In 1751 we moved to Pudsey where</l>
					<l>I not only attended the Meetings of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> but also got</l>
					<l>requainted with them to the blessing of my Heart, &amp; soon</l>
					<l>after was received into the Society. About this Time</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> began to labour powerfully on my Heart, &amp;</l>
					<l>particularly did He make it clear to me what a wretched</l>
					<l>miserable Sinner I was, &amp; I continued for some Time in</l>
					<l>great distress of Soul, not knowing what to do or how</l>
					<l>I should be helped. In this Condition I once went in great</l>
					<l>Heaviness to a Meeting which B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Parminter held, during</l>
					<l>which the Lord manifested Himself to my Heart in his</l>
					<l>bloody Form just so as He expired on the Cross, and He </l>
					<l>asured me that He had blotted out all my Sins &amp; received</l>
					<l>me as by Child. This was an Hour of grace that has never</l>
				</lg>

			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>since been erased out of my Mind. Now I was full of joy</l>
					<l>&amp; Thankfulnes for the mercy He had shown to my Soul. &amp;</l>
					<l>ever since He has given me that grace that  all Times</l>
					<l>&amp; amidst the farther knowlege I had of my own Depravity</l>
					<l>I could always go confidently to Him with all my Concerns</l>
					<l>&amp; cast myself with them upon his merciful Heart &amp; He</l>
					<l>has approved Himself gracious &amp; faithful to me. Jan: 6<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>1757 I was rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> during an overpowering</l>
					<l>feeling of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Love which melted my Heart in such</l>
					<l>a Manner as I am not able to express. apr. 18<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1761 I was</l>
					<l>admitted to the holy Communion, which grace made me</l>
					<l>deeply ashamed, feeling my great unworthiness. This</l>
					<l>caused me to examine more strictly into</l>
					<l>my own Heart, &amp; which also proved the Occasion of my</l>
					<l>diving still deeper into for Heart of Love &amp; experiencing</l>
					<l>more of the grace which He had in Store for me.</l>
					<l>So far her own Account.</l>
					<l>She had a tender Heart to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; spent her</l>
					<l>Time in Communion with Him. Her marriage was</l>
					<l>blest with 10 Children 5 of whom went Home before</l>
					<l>her.  She was in a poor state of Health before the</l>
					<l>Birth of her last child in January &amp; has never been</l>
					<l>well since then. In her Sickness her Children lay,</l>
					<l>upon her Mind with much Concern, &amp; she was exceedingly</l>
					<l>pained at thinking how it might go with them, but</l>
					<l>was obliged to commit them to the Mercy of God</l>
					<l>She was tenderly occupied with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> and what He had done for her &amp; had no Incli</l>
					<l>nation for Conversation about any other Subject, but</l>
					<l>was all alive whenever He was spoken or sung of. The</l>
					<l>time of her Sickness was a Season of real grace &amp; Blessing</l>
				</lg>

			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to her Heart, &amp; on extraordinary presence of our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> was perceived by all the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> whenever</l>
					<l>they visited her, which made it a comfort &amp; Blessing to</l>
					<l>them. Her whole Mind was bent upon going Home,</l>
					<l>Being asked if she should not like to recover again</l>
					<l>she replied: &quot;O no! I would mend again for a 1000 worlds.&quot;</l>
					<l>Being asked by some of her Neighbours, if she was not</l>
					<l>afraid to die, &amp; whether she had no dark apprehen-</l>
					<l>sion at the Thoughts of being soon in Eternity?</l>
					<l>She answered: &quot;no, I have neither Fear nor dark</l>
					<l>apprehensions, but can resign my Soul to my</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> with joy &amp; with the same composure &amp; serenity as when</l>
					<l>I go to sleep at Nights because He has granted me</l>
					<l>the Happiness to know Him as my Friend &amp; Redeemer.&quot;</l>
					<l>She had the holy Communion administred to her</l>
					<l>twice in her House, attended with an extraordinary</l>
					<l>Feeling of grace. Thus she remained, an Edifica</l>
					<l>to those who saw &amp; spoke with her, till it pleased</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> to fetch her Soul to Himself in her 43<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> Year.</l>
