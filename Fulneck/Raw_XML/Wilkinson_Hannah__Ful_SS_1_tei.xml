					<l>The S. S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Hannah Wilkinson was</l>
					<l>born in Gadley near Hallifax Feb. 22<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi></l>
					<l>1755, and baptized in the Church</l>
					<l>of England. As an infant she moved</l>
					<l>with her Parents to Huddersfield.</l>
					<l>She often ralated with pleasure, that</l>
					<l>when she was but a young Child</l>
					<l>her Mother used to take her to</l>
					<l>Church to hear M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Veen, an awake</l>
					<l>end Minister, which often proved</l>
					<l>a great blessing to her, particularly</l>
					<l>as her Mother who was under serious</l>
					<l>concern for herself, &amp; her Children would</l>
					<l>often afterwards speak to her on</l>
					<l>the subject which the Minister had</l>
					<l>treated on, and admonish her not to</l>
					<l>be wild and thoughtless because</l>
					<l>the Lord would then have nothing</l>
					<l>to do with her, this often struck</l>
					<l>her much, and made her pray to</l>
					<l>the Lord to form her according to</l>
					<l>his mind. After some time her</l>
					<l>Mother &amp; she her began to attend the </l>
					<l>Preachings &amp; meetings of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi></l>
					<l>held in Huddersfield; from the </l>

					<l>very first time, it was impressed on</l>
					<l>her mind, that this was the people</l>
					<l>she belonged to, and tho&apos; her Father</l>
					<l>did not approve of it, yet nothing</l>
					<l>could hinder her. In the year 1767</l>
					<l>she came the first time to Fulneck</l>
					<l>with a company of great girls to</l>
					<l>their Festival, she was so much pleas&apos;d</l>
					<l>with this day &amp; the blessings she</l>
					<l>injoyed, that she had no rest</l>
					<l>till she obtained leave to live a</l>
					<l>mongst us the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi>, this favour was granted</l>
					<l>to her the following year, when she</l>
					<l>went to live in the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House</l>
					<l>at that time in Little more. She</l>
					<l>often spoke with pleasure of the</l>
					<l>happy time she spent there, in her</l>
					<l>Childlike simplicity, which was</l>
					<l>truly blessed to her. In Aug. 1771</l>
					<l>she came to live in the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House</l>
					<l>here in Fulnek now a new period</l>
					<l>commenced, she began to feel her</l>
					<l>sinful state by nature, her confi</l>
					<l>dence in our Saviour, and her former</l>
					<l>simplicity was lost, this brought</l>

					<l>her into great trouble, she searched her</l>
					<l>heart and wished to see herself in</l>
					<l>the same light as our Saviour saw </l>
					<l>her, and also to appear so, but</l>
					<l>this proved a great struggle to her.</l>
					<l>However our Saviour gave her grace </l>
					<l>freely to open her mind, which prov</l>
					<l>ed a great comfort and incougage</l>
					<l>ment to her, and being assured that</l>
					<l>our Saviour received sinners, and un</l>
					<l>derstands all our human weaknesses,</l>
					<l>her confidence in him was strenthe</l>
					<l>ned enew, she turned to him with</l>
					<l>a contrite heart, and sought and</l>
					<l>found the forgiveness of her sins in</l>
					<l>his precious blood, and prayed for</l>
					<l>his sanctifiing grace to help her thro&apos;</l>
					<l>in her future course. May 4<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1772</l>
					<l>she was rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the S. S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Choir</l>
					<l>with 16 other great girls, this was</l>
					<l>to her a day of mourning &amp; blessing</l>
					<l>it was a day of sollem solemn sur</l>
					<l>render of heart to our Saviour, that</l>
					<l>his aim and thoughts of pease may</l>

					<l>fully be obtained with her, many sighs</l>
					<l>and tears an this occation went up</l>
					<l>to the throne of grace, which in mercy</l>
					<l>were owned by him. Soon after this</l>
					<l>day, she with 8 other young S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> of</l>
					<l>the said company met together in</l>
					<l>in the Wood, and covenanted with </l>
					<l>each other to live to the Lord, and </l>
					<l>if they saw any thing in each other,</l>
					<l>that their walk and conversation</l>
					<l>was not according to our Saviours</l>
					<l>mind, to speak in love to one an</l>
					<l>other without restraint. They all Kept</l>
					<l>faithful to the Lord, and their pro</l>
					<l>miss except One, which she often</l>
					<l>greatly lamented. Oct 6<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1773</l>
					<l>she was rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> and</l>
					<l>Feb. 4<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1775, she partook for the</l>
					<l>first time of the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>.</l>
					<l>After the new built S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> House in</l>
					<l>Wyke was compleated, she went </l>
					<l>in Aug 1783 as Room overseer with</l>
					<l>9 S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> to inhabit it, here she ex</l>
					<l>perienced many trials of various Kind,</l>
					<l>but our Saviour gave her grace to</l>

					<l>put her trust and confidence in him;</l>
					<l>she was of a chearful &amp; lively temper</l>
					<l>always willing to encourage others &amp;</l>
					<l>to derect them to our Saviour, par</l>
					<l>ticularly the young S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> committed to </l>
					<l>her care, found in her a real friend.</l>
					<l>She was a faithful visitor to the </l>
					<l>sick both in and out of our circle;</l>
					<l>and as it was her delight &amp; pleasure</l>
					<l>to converse with her friends, concer</l>
					<l>ning our Saviours leading with her</l>
					<l>and them, such visits was often</l>
					<l>attended with great blessing.</l>
					<l>On account of a sickly habit and</l>
					<l>some other circumstances; she wished</l>
					<l>to move again to Fulnek, this re</l>
					<l>quest was granted to her May 23<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> 1803,</l>
					<l>after spending nearly 20 years in the </l>
					<l>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House in Wyke, where she was</l>
					<l>useful and beloved. The rejoycd</l>
					<l>at being again in Fulnek, which she</l>
					<l>looked upon as her proper home,</l>
					<l>and often said: &quot;I am now in</l>
					<l>my resting place, where I shall</l>
					<l>end my days; when my Saviour pleases.&quot;</l>

					<l>Of late years she was much troubled</l>
					<l>with Cramp &amp; Rheumatism, but she</l>
					<l>bore it patiently, allways saying with</l>
					<l>a chearful heart, she had much more</l>
					<l>reason to be thankful then to</l>
					<l>complain, when she called to mind</l>
					<l>our Saviours help &amp; support which</l>
					<l>she dayly felt. About 3 weeks be</l>
					<l>fore her departure she was seized</l>
					<l>with uncommen headake &amp; sickness</l>
					<l>which never left her. It troubled</l>
					<l>her sometimes being afraid of loosing</l>
					<l>her senses. Her afflictions was great.</l>
					<l>On the 3<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> of Sept she said with</l>
					<l>faltering voice; &quot;I am in our Saviours</l>
					<l>hand, he must do with me as he </l>
					<l>pleases; I am perfectly resigned to</l>
					<l>his will, &amp; tho I have no particular</l>
					<l>clearness if I shall go to him on</l>
					<l>this occation or recover again, yet</l>
					<l>I am asured he will receive me</l>
					<l>in mercy. What heav&apos;nly hope joy and</l>
					<l>exulation this hope afforts unto</l>
					<l>my heart. Then in his presence </l>

					<l>I for every with the redeem&apos;d shall </l>
					<l>sing his praise O Lord I long</l>
					<l>to have that favour to leave this</l>
					<l>world and see thy face.&quot;</l>
					<l>From this time she could not speak</l>
					<l>any more to be rightly understood,</l>
					<l>neither could she hear nor take</l>
					<l>note of any thing, with foldet hands</l>
					<l>and broken word she prayed to our</l>
					<l>Saviour. The 7<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> in the morning </l>
					<l>it pleased him to release her from</l>
					<l>all suffering in a happy &amp; gentle</l>
					<l>manner in the 55<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year of her age.</l>
