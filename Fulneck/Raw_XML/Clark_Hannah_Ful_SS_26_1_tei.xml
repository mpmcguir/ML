					<l>the Gospel preachd, along with her Sister, after</l>
					<l>some time our Saviour Laid hold on her heart</l>
					<l>in Such a manner, that She had a great desier</l>
					<l>to be long to the Society, but being of a bashfull</l>
					<l>deposishon, She Could not say much for her</l>
					<l>self, thinking herself not worthy of Such a Saviour</l>
					<l>but being in Coragd by her Sr She howeve took</l>
					<l>Corage and was soon received into the Socity at</l>
					<l>Hallfax by Br Horn; in ye year 48 She came to</l>
					<l>Live at Cloketon EOconemy where She Cou<hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>l</hi> was</l>
					<l>some time before She cou&apos;d rightly Settle after</l>
					<l>ter wards, She growing more acquainted with our Saviour</l>
					<l>And grew more Satisfid in the year 50. She remov&apos;d</l>
					<l>to with the rest of the Srs to Tyrselhall, were She got</l>
					<l>a gret Longing and desier to be recived into the</l>
					<l>Congregation, which was granted to her jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> ye 12.</l>
					<l>1752: the Day after She was Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi>, the Sr Askd her</l>
					<l>why She was in such a hury to go to grace hall, the day that</l>
					<l>She was Recived, She being alway usd to be one of the</l>
					<l>Last, O said she I had some thing in my mind, I thought</l>
					<l>perhaps I Shall be recievd therefore I did not Like</l>
					<l>to be to Late, I had a feeling of it but, I did not Like</l>
					<l>to tell any body of it, When the Sisters Enterd the</l>
					<l>Choir-hous She with Some others was orderd to Live</l>
					<l>in pudsey Town, which grived her very much, and</l>
					<l>She said, She Cou&apos;d not reast till She Came to Live</l>
					<l>in the Choir-hous, July ye 15 53 She became a</l>
					<l>Candidat for the Sacrament ye 4th of Nov. in the same</l>
					<l>year She was Confirmd, and Decber ye 6th She pertook of</l>
					<l>the holy Sacrament, for the first time; this provd with a</l>
					<l>great bless to her, from this time forward she grew</l>
					<l>much more Lively and Chearfull then ever, She had</l>
					<l>been before, once as She was going to the Meeting She</l>
					<l>fell and hurt her knee, her Father being a Dacter She</l>
					<l>went to Stay there a while, to see if she Could be Cur&apos;d</l>
					<l>but While She was there, She was much dissatisfid</l>
					<l>and wanted to be at home again, in the Mean time the</l>
					<l>Pudsey EOconemy Came to live in the Choir-hous her Sr</l>
					<l>Going to see her, She Askd her if they was moved, She</l>
					<l>told her Yes, then said She were is my bed and the rest</l>
					<l>of my things, are they in the Choir-hous? She asuerd her</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>that her bed was in the sleep-hall, this rejoiced her</l>
					<l>Very much and She said I am Satisfied if I only</l>
					<l>have the faviour to be in the Hous, She Coud not</l>
					<l>be Satisfied to stay any Longer with her father</l>
					<l>but hastend to come home, and enterd her Choir</l>
					<l>house with much pleasuer; ever since She got that</l>
					<l>hurt in her knee, She has been Sickley, So that on</l>
					<l>could planly see that she was in a declining way</l>
					<l>Since that time nothing, during this her Sickness nothing</l>
					<l>has hapend to destirb her in her Couers of grace but</l>
					<l>She has gone on in a simple, and Child Manner, About</l>
					<l>Christmas 55 She got a bad Cough, and it seem&apos;d as if</l>
					<l>it wou&apos;d turn to a Cunsumtion, Last janry her Sr went</l>
					<l>to visit her father, She Ask her what She Shoud Say to</l>
					<l>him about her, She said I have not much for fisik at</l>
					<l>present, perhaps byenby I Shall want it more then</l>
					<l>now, She was very Still and Complaind but Little</l>
					<l>but when She by degrees grew wors, She had a mind</l>
					<l>to try if enything Could be of servis to her, She</l>
					<l>then Sent to her father but he Said it wou&apos;d be to no</l>
					<l>perpos however She took something which gave</l>
					<l>her Eas&apos; for a short time, but however it was very deserna-</l>
					<l>ble, that her End drew near, this She belived herself</l>
					<l>and at first She took it very Near to heart; that</l>
					<l>She hat not Spent her time in such a tender, Connecttion</l>
					<l>with the man of Sorrows as She Could have wich&apos;d</l>
					<l>She spoke of it to her Sister, but however, said She</l>
					<l>He: Loves me dearly, and has patiene with me; about</l>
					<l>the middle of June, She took to ye Sick-room, when</l>
					<l>She was Ask&apos;d if She Shoud not Like to, be well again</l>
					<l>She answerd No! I will rather go to our Saviour, wile</l>
					<l>She was in the Sick-room, She went once it to the</l>
					<l>hall to the holy Sacrament, when She came home</l>
					<l>again, She was so ill that we thought She would have gone</l>
					<l>directl; but in a little time She recoverd again; when she</l>
					<l>Said I am acceding glad that I have enjoy&apos;d it once more</l>
					<l>with the Congregation, for it is the Last time, She</l>
					<l>was exceeding Light and Chearfull, and said I Can&apos;t</l>
					<l>Express in words, what I have enjoid by the holy</l>
					<l>Sacrament my heart is So refreachd that it has made</l>
					<l>me quit Strong, yet my Longing and desier is to go to him</l>
					<l>who has done so much for me, O I wish that that happier</l>
					<l>time may soon Come, She was thro&apos; her whole sickness</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Exceeing patient and when Any one told her that</l>
					<l>She Lookd very ill O said she I am to be ill, but it is no</l>
					<l>matter; will bear it as well as I Can, it will soon be over</l>
					<l>then I shall be quit well,</l>
					<l>About a Month ago her Class Sisters gave her a fair-</l>
					<l>well Love-feast at which She was very much delighted</l>
					<l>this was the Last time of her Comeing out of the Sickroom</l>
					<l>When She was spoke to for the Sacrament the Last</l>
					<l>time, She Expressd, her Longing desier for it, O Said</l>
					<l>She I would gladly have been with our Saviour before;</l>
					<l>this time it will however be the Last, I Shall now soon be</l>
					<l>with our Saviour; the fourth of this month, She pertook</l>
					<l>of the holy Sacrament, with such A longing and</l>
					<l>Eager heart, that She Cou&apos;d Scarely wait till the</l>
					<l>time Came, when She got the bread into her hands it</l>
					<l>Cant be express&apos;d in words, how Eger she was, as</l>
					<l>also when she took the Cup, it seemt as tho&apos; She</l>
					<l>thought it was the Last time that I shall enjoy it here</l>
					<l>I will now take my fill, A few day before her Departure</l>
					<l>her Cough Stop&apos;d and She grew weaker, the Night</l>
					<l>before her departuer She keept a very hearty band</l>
					<l>with the Sister who watchd with her, and thank&apos;d</l>
					<l>her for all that which She had don for her, She now</l>
					<l>alterd and one Coud see that her hour of Departuer</l>
					<l>Drew Nigh, She Calld out very often for our Saviour</l>
					<l>to fetch her, and not to Let her Stay to Long here, She</l>
					<l>wou&apos;d often Stretch out her Arme as if She Catchd at</l>
					<l>something, saying O he is my dear Saviour He is my</l>
					<l>dear Saviour, O Come my dearst Lamb, Come to</l>
					<l>fetch me, take me into thy Armes, then She said</l>
					<l>to her Sr Now I am satisfied, She said with wat art thou</l>
					<l>Satisfied? She answerd with our Saviour he Lets me</l>
					<l>fell his tender heart, and how much he loves me, ten</l>
					<l>times more then I Could expect? She then feeling her</l>
					<l>Self just redy for going, She sent for Sr Dorgy, She</l>
					<l>thinking them not quick enough, Crid out pray Come</l>
					<l>soon</l>
					<l>When thay Came they began to Sing some Verses</l>
					<l>Sutiable there to, but She however Recoverd again</l>
					<l>and Lay quit still only Desiering the Sisters</l>
					<l>to pray our Saviour that he would soon fetch, her</l>
					<l>Which happend, about half an houer past Eleven in</l>
					<l>the the forenoon, on the eleventh instant when her</l>
				</lg>
			</p>

				<lg>
					<l>Soul took flight into the Armes of her Eternal</l>
					<l>Bridegroom under those words at he End of all her</l>
					<l>Need, be her Unction wounds so red; grant her</l>
					<l>to Lean unshaken &amp;c. will She thy thy gental</l>
					<l>Visag &amp;c pail kiss her upon the heart,</l>
					<l>Open Armes take her,</l>
					<l>Under which words she recived the blessing</l>
					<l>of her Choir, And she recived the last kiss</l>
					<l>with such an inexpressable feeling, and on her</l>
					<l>Countenenc was plainly to be seen the sweet impresh</l>
