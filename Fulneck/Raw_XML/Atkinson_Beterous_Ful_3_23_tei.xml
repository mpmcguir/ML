					<l>Our S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Beterous Atkinson was born</l>
					<l>May the 4<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1742 at Wike in Birstal Parish. To</l>
					<l>she was still baptised in the Church of England, yet as</l>
					<l>her Parents belong&apos;d to the Br<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> from the time of the</l>
					<l>first awakening in this Country, she from her</l>
					<l>Childhood was in the Care of the Sisters. But</l>
					<l>as nothing very particular of the Work of our</l>
					<l>Lord was observed in her Heart, she in her 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> Year</l>
					<l>took some little offence, which ended in a Confusion</l>
					<l>of Mind, and of Consequence a Coldness and Shyness</l>
					<l>towards those, who sought the Prosperity of her Soul</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>took place</hi> which continued till she was married on</l>
					<l>Sept. 21. 1766. The uneasiness of Heart which she was</l>
					<l>never quite free from, become now serious, and this</l>
					<l>was the Period of her Life, in which she was</l>
					<l>actually awakened, and saw and felt that she had</l>
					<l>never known our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, as a Sinner. She</l>
					<l>now sought again for Fellowship with the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi></l>
					<l>and in Dec. 1769 she was readmitted into the Society,</l>
					<l>and after repeated Supplications she was recieved</l>
					<l>into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> April 15<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi>. 1770. She was now at times</l>
					<l>very chearful and increased in the Knowledge of</l>
					<l>herself. Last winter she fell into a lingering state</l>
					<l>of Health, and this no Pains were spared towards</l>
					<l>her Recovery, yet it was all in Vain, and a regular</l>

					<l>consumptive Disorder took Place. As she had</l>
					<l>entertain&apos;d great Hopes of overcoming this Sickness,</l>
					<l>she was so much the more disappointed when she</l>
					<l>was insured of the Contrary, and a certain Fear</l>
					<l>of Death siezed her, which made her at first very</l>
					<l>heavy; But she pray&apos;d our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> so long, till</l>
					<l>he was graciously pleased to remove this from</l>
					<l>her. From thence ensued a settled Hearts Desire</l>
					<l>and longing to be with him the sooner the better,</l>
					<l>and she grew so remarkably in the inner Con, that</l>
					<l>it was a Pleasure to behold it. She had a great</l>
					<l>desire to enjoy the h. Sacrament while here, which she</l>
					<l>also obtained June 24<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> and the Days following</l>
					<l>she was inexpressibly Happy in her Heart, and</l>
					<l>thus she kept growing in our Lord Grace and</l>
					<l>longing after his coming till the 15<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> of July</l>
					<l>when a few Moments before her Soul took</l>
					<l>flight she still said: Sweet Jesus! Her dying</l>
					<l>life lasted 29 years and 2 months.</l>
