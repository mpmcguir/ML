					<l>The S. Sr Ann Bullock who went home Feby 19th 1771</l>
					<l>had noted the following</l>
					<l>I was born at Maningom</l>
					<l>in the Parish of Bradford augst 29 1743 of Church of</l>
					<l>England Parrents, But did not feel any Concern for my salvation</l>
					<l>being very wild till in my 10 year the thought once struck my</l>
					<l>mind, if I went on as I did I should not be sav&apos; d this Could</l>
					<l>me Home uneasiness for a time, but soon vanishd in the delight</l>
					<l>I took in my vain pleasures, as I grew older I felt the depravity</l>
					<l>of my own nature, and the proponsity that lay in me to every</l>
					<l>evil which I had not power to withstand, notwithstanding the</l>
					<l>Convictions I felt to the Contrary, which I did my best to stifel</l>
					<l>as far as possible, My Mother Once took me aside, and</l>
					<l>with great Concem spoke very Closely to me about my bad</l>
					<l>Course telling me that the Lord saw every thing &amp; knew how</l>
					<l>I went on, taking me at the same time how I cou&apos;d be</l>
					<l>answerable for it when I shoud once appear before Him,</l>
					<l>this affected me for some time and I sought as well as I </l>
					<l>cou&apos;d to amend my Life, that I might thereby merit the favour</l>
					<l>of God towards me, this lasted not long neither, before I</l>
					<l>was as bad as ever, My Parrents being recd into the Society</l>
					<l>my Mother often askd me to go with her to the MeetingsÂ </l>
					<l>to which I had no inclination, &amp; therefore putt it off till in</l>
					<l>the year 1761 When my Mother was taken very Ill, the Brn</l>
					<l>often visited her, by which means I got first a Love to them</l>
					<l>thinking there was something discernable in them I had never</l>
					<l>seen in any people before, from the time I went to hear them.</l>
					<l>and it was soon clear to me I belongd to them, I soon made my</l>
					<l>desire known to be red into the Society, which was granted</l>
					<l>me 2 days before my Mothers departure, after my mother</l>
					<l>was gone I could no longer settle at home, but wanted to</l>
					<l>live with Sistrs my Sistr being of the Same mind with me</l>
					<l>She obtained leave to go to gumerfal Oeconomy, and a short</l>
					<l>time after I had leave to go to Holme Oeconomy, but not</l>
					<l>being Quite Settled in my self I was perswaded by my Father</l>
					<l>to return to him, during my stay with him, I had no Satisfaction</l>
					<l>wanting to go back, but coud not got directly leave, but</l>

				<lg>
					<l>rather an admonition which provd a real Blessing to me.</l>
					<l>I tund with my concern to our Saviour who prov&apos;d my freind</l>
					<l>My Father by means of a Conversation with Br Charlesworth</l>
					<l>which was at the Same time a Blessing to me also, inclind</l>
					<l>more willingly to let me go, &amp; in a short time I returnd to</l>
					<l>the Same Oeconomy, after Some time spent not so agreably</l>
					<l>we Spoke our minds to Our Laboress concerning our situation</l>
					<l>after which we got Ellen Lee to live with us from the Choir</l>
					<l>House, with whom we soon after moved to little Moore, here</l>
					<l>I felt at times verry chearfull, Yet longd very much to</l>
					<l>experience, the full asurance of my Sins being forgiven me</l>
					<l>Which I knew I had never rightly felt, it was not long before</l>
					<l>I injoyd that grace for which I can&apos;t sufficiently thank</l>
					<l>and Praise my Savr July ye 17 1768 I was recd into the Congn</l>
					<l>to my great Joy, and abasement and augst 19 the same year</l>
					<l>obtained leave to move to my dr Choir House, which rejoiced</l>
					<l>me very much, on account of my sickly state I went directly</l>
					<l>into the Sickroom where I spent most of my time, it has been</l>
					<l>indeed a School of grace to my heart Especialy, when our Savr</l>
					<l>had made one after the other fitt for his eternal Embraces,</l>
					<l>which prov&apos;d a matter both of Joy &amp; Pain to me, Joy on their</l>
					<l>account but Pain on my own, knowing he had not as yet ataind</l>
					<l>his full aim with me, by bringing me thro&apos; this Sickly Habit of</l>
					<l>Body, to rely Stedfastly on him the true Physician, I felt a</l>
					<l>longing Desire to become a participant of his Corpse &amp; Blood</l>
					<l>Sacramenttaly, it seemd long to me before I injoyd this grace</l>
					<l>but when I partook for the first time July 16 1769 I can never</l>
					<l>express what my poor heart injoy&apos;d, From that time I became </l>
					<l>more Solidly aquainted with my own poverty, and unsinnerlikeness,</l>
					<l>but depriv;d my self of the there injoyment of the Sinners happiness</l>
					<l>thro reasoning &amp; striving to help my self, being unwilling to</l>
					<l>appear as I realy was, which since then has Causd me some</l>
					<l>painfull reflections, in Febry 1770 I had a Severe Fitt of Sickness</l>
					<l>at which time Our Savr manifested himself to me, in such</l>
					<l>a Manner, that I cou&apos;d rejoice in him knowing that</l>
					<l>he was Mine, and that I Shou&apos;d remain his to all Eternity</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>tho&apos; unworthy of the Least of all his Mercies,</l>
					<l>thus far her own account </l>
					<l>Our Saviour has in a very poculiar manner accomplishd his</l>
					<l>work, in Our happilly departed Sistr. She was of a Close</l>
					<l>dissposition &amp; did not like to be a Sinner till our Savr</l>
					<l>thro various means overcame her, it causd both her &amp;</l>
					<l>her Sistrs much pain to perceive, that tho, she sufferd</l>
					<l>So much in her Body, yet she had always a reservedness</l>
					<l>her sickness being of a peculiar Nature together with</l>
					<l>this Causd the Sistrs often perplextity, as well as made</l>
					<l>it very heavy to her, she was otherwise of a submissive</l>
					<l>Tempor &amp; thro her good behaviour gain&apos;d the Love of </l>
					<l>her Sistrs during her abode in the Sickroom where</l>
					<l>She spent 2 whole years. About 4 months ago her</l>
					<l>disorder terminated in a Consumption and Our Savr</l>
					<l>according to his bountifull dealings gave her that </l>
					<l>inexpressible grace, that she got a clearness with Him,</l>
					<l>and know on whom she beloved that all Her fears &amp; apprehensions</l>
					<l>about leaveing her Body &amp; the aproach of Eternity Vanished</l>
					<l>in the happy expectation, of seeing her wounded friend,</l>
					<l>often repeating her longing desire that he might come soon</l>
					<l>Our Savr granted her in her latter days a real Sabatical</l>
					<l>injoyment of his Merits &amp; tho her Cough was troublesome</l>
					<l>to her, she had not much pain, Continuing to Look</l>
					<l>out for that happy Moment which came to her</l>
					<l>great Joy on the 19 of Febry about 10 in the forenoon</l>
					<l>when she departed happily</l>
					<l>with the Blessing of her Choir</l>
