					<l>The S. S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Rachel Roebuck was born</l>
					<l>in Huddersfield Feb. 14<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1735.</l>
					<l>She came to live in Fulneck Oct: 14</l>
					<l>1760, the following year she was</l>
					<l>rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> and Jan. 11. 1767</l>
					<l>she partook for the first time</l>
					<l>of the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. The most of</l>
					<l>her time amongs us, she spent in</l>
					<l>serving families on the place, in</l>
					<l>which situations she showed great</l>
					<l>faithfulness; and injoyed the love</l>
					<l>of those whom she served. </l>
					<l>a few years ago she removed into</l>
					<l>the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> House here, being far advanced</l>
					<l>in years and not able to do much.</l>
					<l>She spent her time happily amongst</l>
					<l>us and her chief concern was to live</l>
					<l>in fellowship and communion</l>
					<l>with our Saviour <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Abl</hi> About a</l>
					<l>fourthnight before her departure</l>
					<l>she was seized with an inward</l>

				<lg>
					<l>tho&apos; she was able to go about; nearly</l>
					<l>in her usual way, but it seemed</l>
					<l>clear to her that she never should</l>
					<l>be better, she often prayed earnestly </l>
					<l>to our Saviour to prepare her for</l>
					<l>himself, and she loked forward with</l>
					<l>joy to that happy moment when</l>
					<l>pain and sorrow would <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>seize</hi> cease and she</l>
					<l>should be with him for evermore.</l>
					<l>Dec 28<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> after having spent a trouble</l>
					<l>some night, &amp; suffered much with</l>
					<l>shortness of <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>bl</hi> breath, she said</l>
					<l>in the morning, that she should</l>
					<l>never go to <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>to</hi> bed again, our Saviour</l>
					<l>would fetch her before another</l>
					<l>night, and so it proved according</l>
					<l>to her faith, about 1 a Clock at</l>
					<l>noon, the wished for hour came</l>
					<l>when she in a peaseful and happy</l>
					<l>manner went over into the arms of</l>
					<l>her beloved Saviour. <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Aged</hi> in her 80 year</l>
					<l>She departed Dec. 31 1812. </l>
