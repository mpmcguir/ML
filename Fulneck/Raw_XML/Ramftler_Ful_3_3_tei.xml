					<l>Memoir</l>
					<l>of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> C. F. Ramftler&apos;s Minister of</l>
					<l>the Brethrens&apos; Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in Bristol.</l>
					<l>who departed this life Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 26<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1822.</l>
					<l>Aged 56 1/2 years. Written by himself</l>
					<l>If Parentage and descent under</l>
					<l>any circumstances be cause for glorying</l>
					<l>I think I have where of to glory. Both</l>
					<l>my Grandparents on the Parental side</l>
					<l>left home and kindred and property &amp;</l>
					<l>whatever was dear to them in the world</l>
					<l>for conscience sake, my Grandfather</l>
					<l>being a Moravian Emigrant and</l>
					<l>my Grandmother Marchioness de</l>
					<l>Monton being one of the French Refugees.</l>
					<l>Of myself I will not glory, cannot</l>
					<l>glory, save that by the Cross of Christ</l>
					<l>the world has been crucified to me, and </l>
					<l>I unto the world, that amidst my</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>manfold infirmities his power has rest-</l>
					<l>ed upon me, and that my numberless Sins</l>
					<l>have I believe been blotled out with his</l>
					<l>precious Blood.</l>
					<l>My Father was</l>
					<l>born at Herrnhut July 6<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1740, and at the</l>
					<l>time of my birth was accountant for the</l>
					<l>Bailiwick of Barby in Saxony, which the</l>
					<l>Brethrens unity then held upon a long lease.</l>
					<l>There I first saw the light of this World</l>
					<l>March 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1780, and shall ever be thankful</l>
					<l>to my God and Redeemer, that born and</l>
					<l>educated in the Bosom of the Brethrens</l>
					<l>Church, I obtained a Birthright to this</l>
					<l>household of God, and have been pre-</l>
					<l>served from selling this Birthright.</l>
					<l>My preservation from gross Sin,</l>
					<l>and my early impressions of Divine</l>
					<l>Grace, are to be solely ascribed under</l>
					<l>Divine blessing to a careful education</l>
					<l>which preserved me the from temptations</l>
					<l>and checked my evil propensities.</l>
					<l>My dear Mother often told me that dur-</l>
					<l>ing her pregrancy with me she had fer-</l>
					<l>vently prayed that I might rather not</l>
					<l>live than not become an heir of heaven</l>
					<l>and that I might become a Preacher</l>

				<lg>
					<l>righteousness preferably among the Hea-</l>
					<l>then. My affectionate Father treated</l>
					<l>me with a degree of severity and I stood</l>
					<l>in awe of him, while My Mother found it</l>
					<l>the most effectual Method of controlling me</l>
					<l>to remind the that by evil doing, I offended</l>
					<l>that Saviour whose love to me had prompt-</l>
					<l>ed him to lay down his life for me. By</l>
					<l>my lively and active disposition I fell into</l>
					<l>many errors, and gave frequent uneasei-</l>
					<l>ness to my Parents. In my 6<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year I</l>
					<l>remember to have had the first indelible</l>
					<l>impression of a Spiritual Nature, at the</l>
					<l>meeting on Good Friday in which the Lord&apos;s</l>
					<l>Death is commemorated. When the Words</l>
					<l>were read: &quot;And he bowed the head, and gave</l>
					<l>up the Ghost,&quot; and the Congregation fell</l>
					<l>on their knees in prayer, or power pervad-</l>
					<l>ed my Mind which I did not then under-</l>
					<l>stand, but which times without number,</l>
					<l>has since then been brought to my reco-</l>
					<l>lection, as a drawing of grace, and a div</l>
					<l>call to give my heart to him who died for</l>
					<l>my Sins.</l>

					<l>After having acquired the rudiments,</l>
					<l>of learning in the Day School at Barby</l>
					<l>I was by my Parents and at my own desire</l>
					<l>removed to the Boarding School at Klein-</l>
					<l>welke in my 7<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year. Though separated</l>
					<l>this early from home at the distance of</l>
					<l>about 150 English miles, I was delighted </l>
					<l>with the idea of the change, the number</l>
					<l>of companions, &amp; the opportunity of improve-</l>
					<l>ment. The mode of living was poor, nor</l>
					<l>was the Method of instruction best calcu-</l>
					<l>lated to improve the mind. After a while</l>
					<l>I lost my vivorcity, and became homesick.</l>
					<l>A dangerous illness seized me, when I</l>
					<l>had been little more than a year at Klein- </l>
					<l>welke: an abscess in the lungs reduced</l>
					<l>me to a skeleton, deprived me of the power</l>
					<l>of speech and brought me to the very</l>
					<l>brink of the grave. My Father upon</l>
					<l>receiving the information hastened to</l>
					<l>see me, and resolved in reliance upon</l>
					<l>God, to take me home in that enfeebled state.</l>
					<l>Altho&apos; told by my Medical attendants, that</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>probably I should be a Corpse, before I</l>
					<l>could reach home and that it ever I should</l>
					<l>recover, My speech would never be restored</l>
					<l>and consequently the idea of Making a</l>
					<l>preacher of me must be entirely given up</l>
					<l>The very thought of returning home cheered</l>
					<l>me, and a commodiens carrarge with</l>
					<l>a bed and a careful nurse being provided</l>
					<l>the Journey was accomplished in 5 days</l>
					<l>in delighthul weather, my arrival at home</l>
					<l>taking place Sep 26<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1787. On the third day</l>
					<l>of the Journey we passed a very uneven</l>
					<l>and stony road the violent shaking of</l>
					<l>which broke the abscess, and led to a co-</l>
					<l>pious discharge of Matter, with a dis-</l>
					<l>tresssing Congh, which made my Father</l>
					<l>momentarily apprehend My death. While</l>
					<l>it proved thro&apos; divine Mercy, that this very</l>
					<l>circumstance laid the foundation to my</l>
					<l>cure which was afterwards gradually pro-</l>
					<l>moted by the use of Iceland moss and other </l>
					<l>remedies under the faithful care of D<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Luberkuhn. This I regard as the first</l>

				<lg>
					<l>striking interposition of Providence in the</l>
					<l>renewed gift</l>
					<l>of life and in the redoubled</l>
					<l>obligation thereby imposed upon me to</l>
					<l>devotee that life to him, to whose service</l>
					<l>I had been devoted at Baptism, and ded-</l>
					<l>cated by many parental prayers.</l>
					<l>After my recovery I again attended</l>
					<l>the Day School, where the opportunities</l>
					<l>for making progress in learning were</l>
					<l>scanty untill in My 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year I received</l>
					<l>private lessons by a Candidate for the</l>
					<l>Lurtheran ministry preparatory to my</l>
					<l>entrance into the Pedagogium of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi></l>
					<l>Unity then established at Barby. Next</l>
					<l>to the pleasures of Gardening and hus-</l>
					<l>bandry, in which during my childhood</l>
					<l>I was delighted to share in the fertile soil</l>
					<l>of my native place. My mind was intent</l>
					<l>upon the acquirement of knowledge, and</l>
					<l>in that view readily sacrificed the former</l>
					<l>delights. Altho I cannot say that my mind</l>
					<l>was then truly Spiritualized, yet my de-</l>
					<l>sire to devote my life to the Ministry in</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='7'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> Unity was then almost as strong</l>
					<l>and distinct as at any Subsequent period,</l>
					<l>tnor am I aware of any secular Motive,</l>
					<l>save the opportunity of study, wherein I</l>
					<l>found my element. My religious views were</l>
					<l>simple, and centered in the love of Christ &amp;</l>
					<l>the obligation of loving him in return. The</l>
					<l>experience of the efficacy of this theme fa-</l>
					<l>miliarily and affectionately presented to the </l>
					<l>youthful mind, tho&apos; not always productive</l>
					<l>at the time of the desired benefit, has in</l>
					<l>later Years made it my pleasing duty, to</l>
					<l>direct Children in the course of My Minis-</l>
					<l>terial labours, to that Saviour, whose his-</l>
					<l>tory in it important bearings they can</l>
					<l>both understand and feel, while dry ar-</l>
					<l>gument and doctrinal statement leave</l>
					<l>their hearts cold and dead.</l>
					<l>April 1<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> 1792 I entered the Pedagogium</l>
					<l>as a Pupil, and during the 5 1/2 Years of</l>
					<l>My residence in it visited My Parents</l>
					<l>House but once in the week, for two hours</l>
					<l>on Sunday, altho&apos; at the distance of but</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='8'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>a few hundred Yards. Under the excel-</l>
					<l>lent tuition of my Preceptors I now made</l>
					<l>rapid progress, and took much pleasure</l>
					<l>in my studies, altho&apos; the very close con-</l>
					<l>finement occasionally produced lowness</l>
					<l>of spirits. In this period while sin</l>
					<l>strengthened with my youth, the Saviour&apos;s love</l>
					<l>overcame its dominion, and while my </l>
					<l>conversion to God was gradual and it is</l>
					<l>impossible for me to point out the date</l>
					<l>of its commencement, I could trace that</l>
					<l>by the Grace of God I became what by nature</l>
					<l>I neither was nor desired to be. The private</l>
					<l>and confidential advice of the Laborer of</l>
					<l>the Acadimicians in Barby will ever</l>
					<l>be held in grateful remembernce by me.</l>
					<l>June 17<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1792 I was received into the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi></l>
					<l>Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n </hi>and on Maundy Thursday in the </l>
					<l>following year partook the first time of</l>
					<l>the H Communion; nor did I ever regret</l>
					<l>having this early been admitted to this feast</l>
					<l>which proved a powerful check to my Sinful</l>
					<l>nature, and profitable Season for self</l>

					<l>examination whenever it returned.</l>
					<l>My Classical studies having been</l>
					<l>compleated I was in Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1797 transferred</l>
					<l>with 13 companions to the Theolgical Se-</l>
					<l>minany at Niesky. The Lectures delivered</l>
					<l>in this institution were profitable to me,</l>
					<l>I took notes of their contents, and devoted My-</l>
					<l>self with a degree of assiduity to the study</l>
					<l>of Divinity. But the simplicity of my mind</l>
					<l>received a shock, mental poison I swal-</l>
					<l>lowed mixed with mental food, vain conceit</l>
					<l>and self dependance seized me, Sceptical</l>
					<l>sentiments laid hold of me and I even con-</l>
					<l>templated the abandonment of the proposed</l>
					<l>career of my life, in which I was prevented</l>
					<l>by my judicious Uncle, whom I visited</l>
					<l>several times in Lower Lusatia. Amidst</l>
					<l>the waywardness of my Mind and the awak-</l>
					<l>ening passions of my Sinful heart, in which</l>
					<l>My Superiors treated me with more harshness</l>
					<l>than wisdom, the desire of preaching the</l>
					<l>Gospel returned to my mind, and an acquaint-</l>
					<l>ance which I formed with a neighbouring</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='10'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Lutheran Clergyman in the Village of</l>
					<l>Arndorf led to an invitation from him</l>
					<l>that I would make a trial of preaching</l>
					<l>in his Church, which I did when barely</l>
					<l>17 years of age. As this was done without the</l>
					<l>previous permission of the Inspector of the</l>
					<l>Seminary, I received a sharp rebuke, but</l>
					<l>afterwards with the Sanction of the U.E.C.</l>
					<l>preached twice again in Chuches before</l>
					<l>I quitted the Seminary.</l>
					<l>In Feb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> 1800, I returned to Barby.</l>
					<l>the Journey being performed in very se-</l>
					<l>vere weather, and in my passage thro&apos;</l>
					<l>Leipsic I spent some time at the house</l>
					<l>of a friend awaiting myself of the oppor-</l>
					<l>tunity of attending various Lectures at</l>
					<l>that University. Now I spent a few</l>
					<l>Months very agreeably at the house of</l>
					<l>my Parents, and occupied myself in</l>
					<l>part with copying Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> Acc<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ts</hi>. In July</l>
					<l>of the same year I received a call to be</l>
					<l>Schoolmaster at Neusalz in Silesia,</l>
					<l>which was my first station of Service</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='11'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and well calenlated to try and humble</l>
					<l>me. The Children of the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> committed</l>
					<l>to my care, had been much neglected by</l>
					<l>my predecessor, inexperience induced</l>
					<l>me to adopt severe measures, and I was</l>
					<l>employed in teaching the Alphabet and</l>
					<l>first rudiments of learning. Yet I en-</l>
					<l>joyed thro&apos; mercy the love and confidence</l>
					<l>of the Parents, was supported by B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r </hi></l>
					<l>Nitschky the Minister of the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> and</l>
					<l>saw that My labour was not in vain</l>
					<l>in the Lord. I lodged in the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>le</hi> B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> House</l>
					<l>My maintenance was very Scanty and</l>
					<l>I was obliged to copy accounts to supply my</l>
					<l>need. Here I had also pretty frequent op-</l>
					<l>portunites of assisting the Minister in</l>
					<l>the public proclamation of the Gospel</l>
					<l>wherein I look much pleasure. A strik-</l>
					<l>ing preservation of my life during my</l>
					<l>residence at Neusalz strengthened my</l>
					<l>conviction that my God had still work</l>
					<l>for me to do in this World, and moved me</l>
					<l>to consecrate myself anew to my Preserver</l>

					<l>and Redeemer. May 1<hi rend='superscript:true;'>9th</hi> 1801 I went by</l>
					<l>the dedication and in the company of a </l>
					<l>friend to the River Oder at the</l>
					<l>distance of about 2 miles from  the town.</l>
					<l>In high spirits did my companion pro-</l>
					<l>ceed and encourage me to follow him.</l>
					<l>But suddenly he sunk in an unexpect-</l>
					<l>edly deep place of the river, and rose no</l>
					<l>more. I stepped after him with a view to</l>
					<l>rescue him, attempting to seize his arm</l>
					<l>the water rose above my head, and I lost</l>
					<l>all power of voluntary motion, consider-</l>
					<l>ing my life as lost. By an inexplica-</l>
					<l>ble Providence, however I was raised &amp;</l>
					<l>found myself standing again on firm</l>
					<l>Ground, thankful for my deliverance</l>
					<l>but agonized on account of the loss of my</l>
					<l>friend. Hastily and in an almost dis-</l>
					<l>tracted state of mind I procured assis-</l>
					<l>tance, removed the drowned body, and</l>
					<l>adopted all practicable means to re-</l>
					<l>susitate it but in vain. Thus one</l>
					<l>was taken and the other left.</l>

				<lg>
					<l>At the conclusion of the Synod in 1801</l>
					<l>I received a call to be a Teacher in the Aca-</l>
					<l>demy for Young Noblemen at Uhyst. Self-</l>
					<l>denying as my station at Neusalz had</l>
					<l>been I left it with considerable regret, be-</l>
					<l>cause I enjoyed the love and friendship of</l>
					<l>Many, and had not been left destitute of</l>
					<l>the blessing of my God. In Uhyst from the</l>
					<l>Superior mode of instruction, as well as</l>
					<l>the greater convenience in the mode I</l>
					<l>life, My abode was pleasant, in addition</l>
					<l>to our domestic circle I enjoyed confiden-</l>
					<l>tial intercounse with the Clergyman of</l>
					<l>the Parish, at whose house I spent many</l>
					<l>evenings after the labour of the day for</l>
					<l>profitable relaxation. Both at the Aca-</l>
					<l>demy and Church I had frequent oppor-</l>
					<l>tunities of testifying of the Grace of God</l>
					<l>in Christ Jesus. Dreary as the Country</l>
					<l>about Uhyst is, the village standing in</l>
					<l>the midst of extensive fir forests, and con-</l>
					<l>fined as my Society there was, the removal</l>
					<l>of the Academy to Great Hennersdorf near</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='14'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Hernhut after I had been only half a year</l>
					<l>there proved painful to me. In Hennersdorf</l>
					<l>also I resided only half a year being in </l>
					<l>the spring of 1803 called to England, to oc-</l>
					<l>cupy the place of first Teacher in the</l>
					<l>newly founded Boarding School at Fair-</l>
					<l>field near Manchester.</l>
					<l>This call which constituted a new</l>
					<l>Epoch in my life, and directed My whole</l>
					<l>official career, and moreover was very</l>
					<l>much contrary to my inclination, and</l>
					<l>plans, and prospects, I could not accept,</l>
					<l>until it had been sanctioned by lot.</l>
					<l>Paying a farewell visit to my Parents, I </l>
					<l>took a painful leave of them, of many dear</l>
					<l>friends, and of my Native land. At Hern-</l>
					<l>burgh I embarked for Hule, and by contrary</l>
					<l>winds was detained three weeks at Cuxhaven</l>
					<l>as a lonely Passenger in the ships cabin.</l>
					<l>when at length having reached the open Sea</l>
					<l>and English Privateer seized us, under</l>
					<l>the mistaken Idea that the French had made</l>
					<l>themselves Masters of Hamburgh.</l>

				<lg>
					<l>The Privateer belonging to Colchester, <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>we were</hi></l>
					<l>we were carried to the Harbour of Wivenhoe</l>
					<l>4 miles from that town. Thus my arrival</l>
					<l>in England seemed very inauspicious;</l>
					<l>coming to a place to which I had no re-</l>
					<l>commendation, Where I could not be intro-</l>
					<l>duced to a Single individual. My situation</l>
					<l>was peculiarly irksome. The English</l>
					<l>language I had indeed learned to read, but</l>
					<l>hearing it for the first time in common con-</l>
					<l>versation I found it very difficult to un-</l>
					<l>derstand it, nor could I readily express</l>
					<l>myself in it. How to proceed, I knew not</l>
					<l>and therefore took my quarters at the Rose</l>
					<l>and Crown Inn Wivenloc, untill I might</l>
					<l>be favored with an answer from Br. Woltin</l>
					<l>in London to whom I wrote. Sunk into mourn-</l>
					<l>ful meditations, I wandered in the fertile</l>
					<l>fields, admiring the beauty of the land-</l>
					<l>scape, but feeling myself cut off from</l>
					<l>all human endearments. Nothing cou&apos;d</l>
					<l>have cheered My mind, but the conviction</l>
					<l>that here I was in obedience to a divine</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='16'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>call, and that he who called me would not </l>
					<l>have nor forsake me. In all my future</l>
					<l>situations and difficulties, it has been my</l>
					<l>great support and consolation, that not by</l>
					<l>my own choice nor even by mere human </l>
					<l>appointment but according to the mode of</l>
					<l>appointing to office in our Church, I occupied</l>
					<l>the places, which I old occupy, and was en-</l>
					<l>gaged in the employments in which I was</l>
					<l>engaged from time to time. The solitude</l>
					<l>also in which I now felt myself, directed</l>
					<l>my mind to the more frequent Communion</l>
					<l>with my Divine Friend and Saviour.</l>
					<l>By the arrival of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Wollin I was</l>
					<l>relieved and with him proceeded to London</l>
					<l>from whence after a few days, I went to</l>
					<l>Fairfield the place of my destination.</l>
					<l>It was consoling after so long an interval</l>
					<l>to be again in a B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. which on fu-</l>
					<l>ture occasions after Journies, I have often</l>
					<l>experienced as a peculiar refreshment</l>

				<lg>
					<l>their members, and a facility of becoming</l>
					<l>acquainted and even intimate with one</l>
					<l>another as belonging to one family, which</l>
					<l>I have no where met with out of our Com-</l>
					<l>mnnity. I reached Fairfield July 15<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1803.</l>
					<l>and has cordially received by B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Willet</l>
					<l>the Domestic Manager, and B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> J. Hyland &amp;</l>
					<l>T. Bird the Assistant Tenchers of the newly</l>
					<l>established Boarding School. My difficul-</l>
					<l>ties under God were greatly eased by the</l>
					<l>friendship of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. W. Foster the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi></l>
					<l>Helper there, also by B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Clemens the</l>
					<l>Minister. The situation was sufficiently</l>
					<l>trying us may easily be conceived when</l>
					<l>it is considered that with my imperfect</l>
					<l>acquaintance with the language and man-</l>
					<l>ners of the Country, it desolved principally</l>
					<l>on me to regulate the School, and to form</l>
					<l>as well as execute the needful plans for</l>
					<l>it future success. Moreover it was incum-</l>
					<l>bent upon me immediately and from thence</l>
					<l>for two years to live alone with 10 Boys or 12</l>
					<l>as the School rapidly increased.</l>

					<l>In June 1805 I received the painful</l>

					<l>In addition to My Minesterial duties</l>

					<l>of instuction. It was likewisel an addition to</l>
					<l>my opportunities of serving My Saviour to</l>
					<l>preach regularly in several neighbouring</l>

					<l>ed by a single view to the Glory of God, and the</l>

					<l>prehand that a constitutimal and vestless</l>
					<l>disposition, finding personal gratification</l>
					<l>in being constantly employed, had a share</l>
					<l>in it. The Lord however blessed my endeavour</l>
					<l>and covered My Sins, which were greater</l>

					<l>My reproofs of others were often severe, and</l>

					<l>of compassion, and alas! how apt aare we</l>
					<l>to forget our own blemishes in attempt-</l>

					<l>exertion, and perceived that My labours</l>

					<l>was generally numerous, and instances</l>

					<l>A year after my arrival at Fulneck</l>

					<l>In her unfolding faculties I had, combined</l>

					<l>During the Provincial Conference</l>
					<l>which in July of the Year just mentioned</l>

					<l>My Valedictory Sermon was preached</l>
					<l>at Fulneck on Sept 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1824 to a very large</l>
					<l>concourse of people, and on the same day</l>

					<l>mental trials connected with it being</l>
					<l>much smaller than those in My former</l>

					<l>life during any proceeding period more</l>
					<l>than during my residence at Bristol,</l>
					<l>which while I write has continued for</l>
					<l>6 1/2 years. The Lord dealt very mercifully</l>

					<l>remaining hours of the day, when much</l>

					<l>rapid journey of only 10 days from Hern-</l>

					<l>In addition to the ordinary labours</l>

					<l>peculiar pleasure in advocating the</l>
					<l>extention of our Saviours Kingdom among</l>
					<l>the heathen, and had many doors for so</l>
					<l>doing opened to me by Providence. In</l>
					<l>1829 I undertook I extensive journies by</l>
					<l>commission from the London Association</l>
					<l>in aid of the Brns Missions, and was both</l>
					<l>delighted and edified by finding open doors</l>

				<lg>
					<l>and open hearts, and unfeigned cordiallity</l>
					<l>and cooperation in all places and among</l>
					<l>all communities and their Ministers whom</l>
					<l>I visited. The latter part of these 2 journies</l>
					<l>was however rendered peculiarly pain-</l>
					<l>ful and distressing to me by the intelli-</l>
					<l>gence which I received at the close of a</l>
					<l>day of arduous duty, that My dear child</l>
					<l>had been seized with a dangerous illness</l>
					<l>at Fulneck, where for 3 years she had</l>
					<l>been seperated from us at School, and</l>
					<l>that her Mother during my absence had</l>
					<l>gone to see and nurse her, the accounts</l>
					<l>being very alarming none probably can</l>
					<l>conceive what I felt, except a parent of</l>
					<l>on only child, just on the point finishg</l>
					<l>her education, and of whom pleasing ex-</l>
					<l>pectations of fruit from the seed carefully</l>
					<l>sown and entertained, such a child I ap-</l>
					<l>prehended might have been called into</l>
					<l>eternity at a distance of 400 miles from</l>
					<l>me, the anxious suspence in which I</l>
					<l>was held for several days was the more</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='41'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>painful as my appointed duty required that</l>
					<l>in this state of mind I should travel and preach</l>
					<l>going strangers day by day.</l>
					<l>In my return home the intelligence</l>
					<l>received was still more alarming, and</l>
					<l>I was constrained with the utmost speed</l>
					<l>to proceed to Fulneck where thro&apos; mercy</l>
					<l>I found the child somewhat better under</l>
					<l>her Mothers care, and the faithful atten-</l>
					<l>dance on the part of the School. During</l>
					<l>this trial I found it difficult to pray</l>
					<l>with that Submission, which I had often</l>
					<l>urged upon others, I did pray fervently</l>
					<l>for the child, and consider her gradual</l>
					<l>recovery as an express answer to prayer.</l>
					<l>Next to the consoling effect of communion</l>
					<l>with My Lord, and the powerful relief</l>
					<l>obtained by speaking to him as a friend,</l>
					<l>the sympathy of my B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> was truly</l>
					<l>soothing to me. I had received many good</l>
					<l>things at the hand of the Lord, it was time</l>
					<l>that I should submissively receive evil</l>
					<l>or rather what at the time appears to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='42'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>be evil, being painful to flesh and blood. </l>
					<l>Active duties I had long exercised, passive</l>
					<l>duties I found it much more difficult to</l>
					<l>bear. Trials were needed to teach me</l>
					<l>patience and confidence, to preserve me</l>
					<l>from presumption and undue earthly</l>
					<l>attachments, to fit me for bearing with</l>
					<l>the infirmities and sharing in the suf-</l>
					<l>ferings of others, in fire, to fit me both</l>
					<l>for my Ministry and for entrance in</l>
					<l>to the evalasting Kingdom of Christ.</l>
					<l>In Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1829 our child was so far restored</l>
					<l>as to come home with her Mother, and</l>
					<l>since then has continued with us be-</l>

					<l>he was overtaten by heavy rain and</l>

					<l>a dangerous disease. This continued</l>
					<l>for some months gradually to gain ground</l>

					<l>This was to him a severe strike; for</l>

					<l>the same state till about two months pre-</l>
					<l>vious to his decease, when his appetite</l>
					<l>began to fail, and he was unable to the</l>

					<l>still continuing in the discharge of</l>

					<l>not expect to see him much longer</l>
					<l>among us.</l>
					<l>On the 15<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> he went to Brockwear</l>

					<l>On Sunday the 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> in a state of extreme</l>

					<l>on the D.W. for the day. &quot;The memory of the</l>

					<l>and warmth on the Words of our Saviour</l>
					<l>to the Paralytic man, Matth. 11 2 &quot;Son</l>
					<l>be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee.&quot;</l>
					<l>This occasion was one of a most affecting</l>
					<l>nature, and few of those who were present</l>
					<l>will easily forget it. The discourse was</l>
					<l>listened to as the Words of a dying man,</l>
					<l>the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> felt as it he was taking his</l>
					<l>public leave of them, and participated in</l>
					<l>the feelings of the Elders of the Church of</l>
					<l>Ephesns, Sorrowing most of all that they</l>
					<l>should see his face to more. In the after</l>
					<l>noon he made an attempt to keep the Widows</l>

				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='48'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to dismiss them after a short prayer.</l>
					<l>On Monday he went to the house of a kind</l>
					<l>friend in Clifton, as it was hoped that </l>
					<l>change of air and scene might be of tem-</l>
					<l>porary use to him. But this was not the</l>
					<l>case, his strength rapidly declined. and</l>
					<l>a drowsiness came on him, so that near-</l>
					<l>by the whole of that day and Tuesday he</l>
					<l>was in a dying state. On Tuesday a friend</l>
					<l>called, and found him on the bed, it was</l>
					<l>remarked, I fear you feel very weak. </l>
					<l>&quot;Weak, weak, weak,&quot; was his reply. In a</l>
					<l> somewhat lower tone. &quot;How very weak</l>
					<l>I am, My Saviour well can see.&quot; When</l>
					<l>looking round, &quot;I long to be delivered from</l>

					<l>but one is so useless lying here.&quot;</l>
					<l>An Affectionate message was delivered</l>
					<l>from B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. P. La Trobe, adding that he would</l>
					<l>gladly come down to assist him, had not</l>

					<l>you look forward to that?&quot; As of recol-</l>
					<l>lecting his state, be calmly said, &quot;I look</l>

					<l>On Wednesday he expressed his desire</l>
					<l>to return home, having prepared his</l>
					<l>Sermon for that evening, and being parti-</l>
					<l>cular desirous to Preach as he said he</l>
					<l>had some delightful meditations on the</l>
					<l>subject during the morning. He was con-</l>
					<l>ducted down stairs and into the Car with</l>
					<l>dificulty; on our arrival at home all</l>
					<l>his strength seemed to be gone, and after</l>
					<l>being supported into his Study he fainted</l>
					<l>away. By the application of suitable means</l>
					<l>he revived, and being asked how he felt,</l>

			</p>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>replied, &quot;I am in very blessed Meditation.&quot;</l>
					<l>In the afternoon he was not quite himself</l>
					<l>but spoke rather incoherently, and repeated-</l>
					<l>ly asked if it was not time for the evening</l>
					<l>Service being affraid lest we should deceive</l>
					<l>him. About 5 o cleck he became quite sen-</l>
					<l>sible, said he was <hi rend='underlined:true;'>very</hi> weak, and asked</l>
					<l>who was going to Preach? and when I said</l>
					<l>Br Seifferth he seemed quite contented.</l>
					<l>I asked him if he felt our Saviours pre-</l>
					<l>sence? he said &quot;I feel very happy and long</l>
					<l>to go.&quot; I said I thought it would not be long.</l>
					<l>He said, &quot;Do for think so? catching at my</l>
					<l>words as if quite delighted with the idea.</l>
					<l>With the Assistance of a B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r </hi>we got him</l>
					<l>up stairs to bed, and called in D<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. Pretch-</l>

					<l>in his throat, be enquired if we heard it</l>
					<l>and made the remark: &quot;That will carry</l>
					<l>me a good way to night.&quot; About nine oClock</l>
					<l>he fell into a deep sleep from which he</l>

					<l>after a Pilgrimage of 52 years &amp; 7 Months.</l>
					<l>Thus was this faithful Servant called</l>
					<l>and by his gracious Master into his eternal</l>
					<l>rest - a rest, into which, more especially</l>
					<l>during the latter period of his illness, he</l>
					<l>expressed his most ardent desire soon to en-</l>
					<l>ter. When his health was suffering under</l>
					<l>the first attack, and his speedy dissolution</l>
					<l>was by some apprehended, and by himself</l>
					<l>thought not improbable, he expressed his</l>
					<l>perfect resignation to the will of God, whe-</l>

					<l>for repose, his all absorbing desire</l>
					<l>was, &quot;to depart, and to be with Christ.&quot;</l>
					<l>He said not much in his latter days rela-</l>
					<l>tive to his departure, but what be did say</l>
					<l>showed that his Mind was in a state of</l>

					<l>nor was he ready to allow mere consideration</l>
					<l>of difficulty or labour for a moment to</l>
					<l>interrupt any plan that seemed likely to</l>
					<l>advance it. This Singleness of view could</l>
					<l>not but win the respect even of those to whom</l>

					<l>bed of the sick.</l>
					<l>As a <hi rend='underlined:true;'>Minister</hi>, he was a scribe well</l>
					<l>instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven.</l>
					<l>His naturally strong talents were furnishd</l>
					<l>with materials by assiduous Study. The</l>
					<l>word of God was the mine in which he con-</l>
					<l>tinually delved, and having in his ownh</l>
					<l>heart felt the vitality of its truths, he was</l>
					<l>enabled to place them before his heavens with</l>
					<l>the clearness of spiritual discernment, and</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='53'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>that freshness which self experience alone</l>
					<l>can impart. His discourses were distin-</l>
					<l>guished by great perspicuity and power,</l>
					<l>his mind readily grasped the bearings of</l>
					<l>his subject, and he had the faculty of</l>
					<l>placing it in a strong light before his</l>
					<l>hearers. But above all there was a warmth</l>
					<l>of heart and an earnestness for the sal-</l>
					<l>vation of souls, which under the operation</l>
					<l>of the Holy Spirit brought home the truth</l>
					<l>to the heart, and we have with humility</l>
					<l>to thank the Lord that his Ministry here,</l>
					<l>as well as in former stations, has been</l>
					<l>attended by <hi rend='underlined:true;'>his</hi> distinguished blessing, that</l>
					<l>many Souls have through him been</l>
					<l>brought to a knowledge of their lost state</l>
					<l>by nature, and been led to the cross of</l>
					<l>Christ, and found pardon and peace thro&apos;</l>
					<l>them, and that the weak believer has been</l>
					<l>strengthened, the desponding encouraged</l>
					<l>the mourner comtorted, and many, we</l>
					<l>trust, established and built up in the </l>
					<l>faith.</l>

					<l>It was his delight to present to his fel-</l>
					<l>low Sinners that salvation, which was pro-</l>
					<l>cured by the sufferings and death of the</l>
					<l>incarnate Son of God, in all its fulness</l>
					<l>and freeness and to point him to the Lamb</l>
					<l>of God as taking away the Sins of the World.</l>
					<l>Yet he withheld no part of the counsel of</l>
					<l>God. He insisted upon the vital nature</l>
					<l>of true faith in Christ, and the conse-</l>
					<l>quent necessity of its purifying the heart</l>
					<l>and manifesting itself in works of love.</l>
					<l>His Sermons had therefore always a</l>
					<l>practical character, evangelical prin-</l>
					<l>ciples being traced to their legitimate</l>
					<l>operations in the Mind and their effect</l>
					<l>upon the life. He was well acquainted</l>
					<l>with the deceitful workings of the human</l>
					<l>heart, and with unsparing hand would</l>
					<l>tear away the disguises under which</l>
					<l>they were concealed. No hearer was allowd</l>
					<l>to forget himself, and his own case under</l>
					<l>the consideration of bare generalities, but</l>
					<l>the Preacher by making not indeed <hi rend='underlined:true;'>personal</hi></l>

					<l>but individual application of the truth, </l>
					<l>??? to manifest it so as to &quot;come</l>
					<l>mind himself to every mans conscience</l>
					<l>in the sight of God.&quot;</l>
					<l>May the bright paths of active oper-</l>
					<l>ation which he had in the Lord&apos;s service</l>
					<l>(and for which we ascribe not the glory</l>
					<l>to him, but to the grace of God that was</l>
					<l>in him) serve as an example to sti-</l>
					<l>mulate us all. This defect let us avoid</l>
					<l>they were to him a cause of painful </l>
					<l>humilation: but let us recognize the</l>
					<l>truths of a devoted diciple of Christ</l>
					<l>conspicuous in this his Servant,</l>
					<l>and pray that he may have grace</l>
					<l>its follow him in as far as he followed</l>
					<l>the Divine Master. May the Lord be</l>
					<l>graciously pleased to pour down a double</l>
					<l>portion of his Spirit on those who are ???</l>

					<l>others who may be willing to spend themselves</l>
					<l>and be spent in His Service!</l>
