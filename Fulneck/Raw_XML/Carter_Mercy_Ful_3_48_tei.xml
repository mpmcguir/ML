					<l><hi rend='underlined:true;'>Occurrences in Wike Cong</hi><hi rend='underlined:true; superscript:true;'>n</hi><hi rend='underlined:true;'> for the Month of Jan. 1771</hi></l>
					<l>Out of Wyk Plan</l>
					<l>On the 4<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Jan</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>The 4th</hi> our dear S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Mercy Carter went to our Saviour. Of her</l>
					<l>Course thro&apos; this World the following is to be observed:</l>
					<l>She was born at Greatland in Hallifax Parish: March 29<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>1716, and brught up in the establishd Church. Her Parents depar</l>
					<l>ting this Life when she was very young, and they being at the same</l>
					<l>time but low in the World, she was cared for by the Town to which</l>
					<l>she belong&apos;d. and tho&apos; she was in the midst of the World in her 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>and 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Years, yet she could not be brought in the comon sinful</l>
					<l>Track thereof, partly oweing to an invisible Hand of Preservation</l>
					<l>from our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, and partly to Stirrings and Convictions she had</l>
					<l>in her Heart from her earliest Remembrance. This Spark, which</l>
					<l>lay in her soul from a Child, was fed and nurish&apos;d by the Testi</l>
					<l>mony she heard of M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ingham and M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Dellamot of the free grace</l>
					<l>in Jesus Blood and Death. and being very anxious and Restless</l>
					<l>for the Forgiveness of her Sins and true life out of Jesus in her</l>
					<l>Heart, she followed the Course and Track peculiar to those times,</l>
					<l>in hearing the Reaching of the Gospel; But her poor Soul never</l>
					<l>found Deliverance and Peace, till in the Year 1739, when she once heard</l>
					<l>our dear B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Beohler, during which our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> manifested,</l>
					<l>himself to her, so as he sweated Bloody in the Garden of</l>
					<l>Gethsemane on her account: This not only gave her love and</l>
					<l>Peace, but life and love. In 1746 a Society of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi></l>
					<l>was settled at Greetland, to which she belong&apos;d from the Begining.</l>
					<l>In 1746 she was married to the present Widower. When the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi></l>
					<l>removed from Newhouse, she and her Husband moved with</l>
					<l>our B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Jeremy Carter into the same in order to be nearer the</l>
					<l>Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> into which she was received at Fulneck May 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1759</l>
					<l>and the following year <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>in</hi> Sep<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi>: 3<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> she with her Husband enjoy&apos;d</l>
					<l>the holy Comunion for the first time with the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. Their</l>
					<l>Marriage has been bless&apos;d with 4 Child<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>, 1 is already with the</l>
					<l>Lord, and 1Son and 1 Daughter are in the respective Choir</l>
					<l>Houses at Fulneck, for which she was inexpressibly thankful</l>
					<l>to our dear Lord.</l>

					<l>she being an applied of solid Sister, and as such respected by</l>
					<l>our People, she was accordingly made use of as a Helper in</l>
					<l>a Band; and when the late Helpers Conference was settled </l>
					<l>she became a Member thereof. Our late Sister had a peculiar</l>
					<l>Talent for visiting her Sisters, and contriving to relieve the</l>
					<l>needy and those in Distress. When in the dayly Course of</l>
					<l>her House affairs, she got an impulse to visit this as the</l>
					<l>other Sister, either confined by Sickness, or whereever she felt it</l>
					<l>was necessary, she acquainted her Husband with her Intention</l>
					<l>and recommended herself to him for that Purpose; and he</l>
					<l>during her absense would Sigh to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> in her behalf,</l>
					<l>that his aim with her Visiting might be answered; and</l>
					<l>when in the Evening she related to him of what had occurred,</l>
					<l>they both rejoiced together that our dear Lord had heard the</l>
					<l>Sighs of the one and blessed the weak Endeavours of the</l>
					<l>other.</l>
					<l>Whenever one of our Sisters was in external need,</l>
					<l>she used to go about among the heartiest Sisters, and pro</l>
					<l>pose to make a Collection for the Relief of such a one;</l>
					<l>in which she always succeeded, and as for her own Part</l>
					<l>in such a Case, her left hand did not know what her right</l>
					<l>Hand did.</l>
					<l>Thro&apos; her very maternal and loving Way, peculiar to</l>
					<l>herself, she gain&apos;d the affection of such Child<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> who were not</l>
					<l>her own, but about her in such a manner, that they would</l>
					<l>scarcey be seperated from her; and where ever she could</l>
					<l>invent any thing to be helpful to them wether it related to</l>
					<l>internal or external Matters, in order to secure them for</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, she left no Stone unturned, and as a Proof</l>
					<l>that our dear Lord was with her in this Respect she</l>
					<l>has left Trails behind her new in the single Sisters House</l>
					<l>at Fulneck</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>the heaviest Circumstances, which she experienced during</l>
					<l>her course of grace, happened about a year and a half ago,</l>
					<l>when her eldest Son turning quite from our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> and the</l>
					<l>Inclinations and Convictions he had in his Heart, when among</l>
					<l>the Boys, so that the Steps he then took caused her much grief</l>
					<l>and trouble. and altho&apos; she became comforted by our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>upon that head, that she could leave the Issue to his merciful</l>
					<l>heart, yet her sickly Tabernacle reiceved such a Shock thereby,</l>
					<l>that we are inclined to think it rather proved a Furtherance</l>
					<l>to her Dissolution. about 4 month ago she uttered the first</l>
					<l>apprehension that she should not be here long, for she said to</l>
					<l>her Husband when coming from the married festival last</l>
					<l>Septs this will be the last married festival I shall celebrate!</l>
					<l>an old Breast complaint which was renew&apos;d by getting repeated</l>
					<l>later and a bad State of Blood, were seemingly the Cause of</l>
					<l>her going to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. about 2 Month ago she was the</l>
					<l>last time here of the h. Comunion, and tho&apos; exceeding weak</l>
					<l>yet very much rejoiced to be once more together with her</l>
					<l>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> and S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> in so Solemn an Ocasion: for she was a very</l>
					<l>constant attender of all the Meetings. The nearer she</l>
					<l>drew to her End the more Childlike she became, and used to express</l>
					<l>herself thus, I want to be nothing else than my Saviours little</l>
					<l>Child! She was always much pleased and comforted when</l>
					<l>she was visited, especially by her Band Sisters: after our</l>
					<l>last Comunion B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> and S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Tander brough her her share</l>
					<l>after which she had long&apos;d much and which she enjoy&apos;d</l>
					<l>with great Eagerness together with her Husband. She being</l>
					<l>once asked how she was and felt in her Heart? she answered,</l>
					<l>my Heart is happy, I am my Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> little Child, He shall</l>
					<l>so with me what he pleases! On the 4<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> instant B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Tander call&apos;d there, and finding her remarkably altered,</l>
					<l>told her, that she would soon be with her Redeemer, she</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>answered: that&apos;s well, I have nothing to plead but his</l>
					<l>precious Blood and Rightousness. having sung a few</l>
					<l>verses with her, and telling her that she departed, to our dearest Lord with the</l>
					<l>entire Blessing of his Church below, and she sitting by the fire</l>
					<l>side, she bowed down her Head in order to have it imparted</l>
					<l>to her; this being done, there was such a feeling of our</l>
					<l>dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Presence, that none present could refrain from</l>
					<l>shedding Tears. And tho&apos; there was not an immediate</l>
					<l>Appearance of her going directly, yet after having taken</l>
					<l>leave of her Child<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> and those she had been like a Mother</l>
					<l>to, she laid down, and in about 4 Hours after, her happy</l>
					<l>Soul took its&apos; Flight into the Wounds of Jesus.</l>
