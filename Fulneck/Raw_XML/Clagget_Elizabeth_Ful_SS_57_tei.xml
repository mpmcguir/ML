					<l>This is a memoir of</l>
					<l>S S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. Elizt Claggett.</l>
					<l>She has left in her Choir house a good odour behind her,</l>
					<l>so that those who were acquainted with <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>her</hi>, and had an</l>
					<l>opportunity to converse with her, will always retain a</l>
					<l>blessed remembrance of the grace which our dear</l>
					<l>Lord had bestowed upon her.</l>
					<l>Tho&apos; she has not, for some time past, frequent<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ed</hi> the meetings</l>
					<l>on acct of her disorder, yet it was remarkable that she</l>
					<l>always had a feeling &amp; partook of those blessings which</l>
					<l>were enjoyed by the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> or her Choir, and would speak</l>
					<l>of it to the S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> as if she had been in the meeting.</l>
					<l>Some <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>short</hi> time before her dissolution, her peculiar</l>
					<l>disposition, namely a shyness to see or speak w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> any but</l>
					<l>a few particular friends, went to an extreme, but</l>
					<l>this served to her greater humiliation, and she became</l>
					<l>so loving, that she could not sufficiently express her</l>
					<l>gratitude, love &amp; thankfulness to all about her,</l>
					<l>often repeating: I love &amp; think you, I love &amp; thank</l>
					<l>you all. and desired often those who came to her to</l>
					<l>kiss her. It was a great pleasure to be with her in</l>
					<l>her last days, the Serenity &amp; happiness of her heart, not</l>
					<l>withstanding her great pains, made her sick room</l>
					<l>pleasant, tho her disorder would else have been very</l>
					<l>disagreeable to the outw<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> senses of those who came into</l>
					<l>the room. At last, her long &amp; ardent wish to be dissolved</l>
					<l>and with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> came happily to pass on the 12<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi></l>
					<l>Inst; with a sensible feeling of her Bridegroom&apos;s</l>
					<l>Nearess, &amp; w<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> the blessd of her Choir in the 52<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Yr of</l>

				<lg>
					<l>I was born in Yorkshire in the year 1715 where I staid with my</l>
					<l>Mothers Relations till the year 20 in which my Mother came &amp; fetch&apos;d me</l>
					<l>to London. I remember to have head some Influences of Grace even in my</l>
					<l>Infant years, but when I was about 14 Years of age, I came under strong</l>
					<l>Convictions. in the rights I was sometimes so terrified, that I thought I</l>
					<l>realy heard the Trumpet give the Signal of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> coming to Judgment.</l>
					<l>I believed I shou&apos;d be in the Number of those who would call on the Rocks</l>
					<l>&amp; mountains to cover them. I made repeated Resolutions of devoting my fu</l>
					<l>ture life if God shou&apos;d spare me a little longer, to his Service. I began to be</l>
					<l>pretty diligent in Prayer, both publick &amp; private, &amp; in the 15<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year of my Age</l>
					<l>having now read in Invitation from one of my Aunts in Yorkshire a religi</l>
					<l>ous woman, to go &amp; stay some Time with her; having first intreated the Lord</l>
					<l>with many Tears, that he wou&apos;d direct this affair, I ask&apos;d &amp; obtaind leave of</l>
					<l>my Father &amp; Mother to go. She encouraged &amp; instructed me as will as she</l>
					<l>could, which I prosicuted in my way, but was never satisfied. when I</l>
					<l>was 17 years old, I went to the Sacrament in the Church of England, for the</l>
					<l>first Time. I was near 19 years old when I returnd back to London, where</l>
					<l>I still continued a kind of religious course, but the Gayeties and Divertions of</l>
					<l>the Town, strongly took hold of my Heart, till in my 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> year, when I got such</l>
					<l>a sense of the total Depravity of my nature, that I believ&apos;d the very marrow of</l>
					<l>my Bones was infected with sin. I had never heard of any ones being awakend</l>
					<l>nor did I know there was such a Thing; so I concluded there was not another</l>
					<l>such vile wretch existing as my self. I got various Books of Devotion</l>
					<l>but cou&apos;d not use any of them; so I concluded they were not calculated for</l>
					<l>such a Creature as I. I then betook myself to David&apos;s Psalms, &amp; from thence</l>
					<l>collected sentences &amp; to Compild Prayers which express&apos;d the Language of my</l>
					<l>Heart. I often fell prostrate on the Floor &amp; with Floods of Tears, lamented</l>
					<l>my wretched state; some-Times I had a Glimmering of hope; these words often</l>
					<l>aleviated my distress &quot;perfect Love casts out Fear, for Fear hath Tor</l>
					<l>ment, to which my heart answerd &quot;Yes Lord, that Fear hath Torment I know</l>
					<l>very well, if there be a Love which casts it out, bestow it upon me.</l>
					<l>another Text also was much in my mind; Except ye eat the Flesh of the</l>
					<l>Son of man &amp; drink his blood ye have no Life in you: to which my Heart</l>
					<l>replied &quot;where shall I get this Blood? Why in the Sacrament, but that I dare</l>
					<l>not partake of lest I eat &amp; drink my own Damnation. (I had intirely left</l>
					<l>off going to the Sacrament, since I came to a sense of my Sinful Nature).</l>
					<l>One Day meditating about that Blood, I resolved on a Saints day to go to</l>
					<l>St Lawrances Church, &amp; by when I come there if I cou&apos;d venture to go to the</l>
					<l>Sacrament, I chose that Place rather than my own Parish Church, for my Friends</l>
					<l>&amp; acquaintance already thought I was out of my Senses, so I concealed every Thing</l>
					<l>which had the appearance of Religion as much as I could. accordingly I went to</l>
					<l>the above mentioned Church: after the first Service I remained dubious whether</l>
					<l>I shou&apos;d stay the Sacrament or not; I then opend my common Prayer Book on</l>
					<l>these Words of the Psalms, &quot;unto the wicked faith God, why dost thou teach</l>
					<l>my Laws or take my Covenant into thy mouth. with this I was quite stund &amp;</l>
					<l>thus I went directly <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>out of the Church</hi> home, &amp; then to my chamber, where I</l>
					<l>fell prostrate, &amp; silently pourd forth Streams of Tears. I went on in a</l>
					<l>disconsolate Solitary way conversing but little with any one; at length I con</l>
					<l>tracted some acquaintance with an old women who was a Presbyterian</l>
					<l>She some-Times spoke words of Consolation to me, tho&apos; I afterwards believ&apos;d</l>
					<l>she herself did not understand them. In my 22<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> year, during the Passion Week</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>week I enjoid a particular serenity of mind. being wearied of my own strive</l>
					<l>ings, &amp; finding my last Resolutions to be but vain; I steid my self in some mea</l>
					<l>sure upon Grace &amp; Mercy, hopeing it might extend even to me. in this week</l>
					<l>I visited that Woman, I told for of my desire to go to the Sacrament, &amp; also</l>
					<l>related my Scruples, the encouraged me to venture, saying I shou&apos;d thereby</l>
					<l>get strength &amp; nourishment to pursue my future course. I thought tho&apos;</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r </hi>would not accept of me before, perhaps he will now; so I con</l>
					<l>cluded that if the same stillness &amp; compoture of mind, I then enjoyd</l>
					<l>continued till Sunday I would venture: it continued, &amp; on Easter Sunday I</l>
					<l>arose in a calm bowedness of Heart, &amp; went to the early Sacrament</l>
					<l>which was kept at my own Parish Church. At receiving of the Bread &amp; </l>
					<l>Wine, an awe seized one, so that my Hand trembled greatly, which caused</l>
					<l>the Minnister to stare <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>at stare</hi> at me, but the Love, Peace &amp; Joy which</l>
					<l>in those moments took Possession of my Soul, words cannot express.</l>
					<l>I return&apos;d home so chearful lightsome &amp; happy, that it seem&apos;d to me as</l>
					<l>if I went on Wings. being come Home I met with many Things not very agre</l>
					<l>able, but so passionate as I used to be before, now nothing disturbed me;</l>
					<l>I loved every Body to exceedingly that I thought I could have laid down &amp; let them</l>
					<l>tread upon one. I long&apos;d to be again at Church out of the Sight &amp; hearing of</l>
					<l>Earthly Things, to thither I went again at 10 O&apos;Clock, my Heart was in such a</l>
					<l>desolveing condition that the Tears would now &amp; then Start out of my Eyes, which</l>
					<l>the People observing, told my Relations that now I was indeed gone out of</l>
					<l>my senses for I had Wept at Church; which oblig&apos;d me to get a retired Seat</l>
					<l>among ordinary Old People. In the Nights my Heart would be singing Hosan</l>
					<l>as &amp; Hallelujahs, for I knew not right what to sing or say, nor what had hap</l>
					<l>pen&apos;d to me; other Things as well as my self seemd alterd, &amp; the Scriptures</l>
					<l>as if I had never read them before, but for all this I had Times of Hea</l>
					<l>viness, &amp; if my Feeling was long withdrawn, even of doubting of my Sal</l>
					<l>vation. soon after this a poor Woman coming <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>came</hi> to my Fathers House to begg</l>
					<l>some relief for her Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> who was ill of a Cancer in her Breast, I had a desire</l>
					<l>to visit the Sick Person, &amp; accordingly went to her Lodging, there I for the first</l>
					<l>time saw Bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Hutton who was then in his Apprenticeship, &amp; thro&apos; his means I</l>
					<l>become acqainted with Whitefield Wesleys &amp; others of the Methodists, among</l>
					<l>whom I continued till in the year 1740 when the Bre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> began their Labour</l>
					<l>in England. I knew directly that they were the People for me, since which</l>
					<l>Time I adhered to them entirely. in June 1742 I went with great Reluctance</l>
					<l>but in compliance with my Fathers commands to spend the Summer with</l>
					<l>the rest of our Family at Broadoaks in Essex, I had been there 2 or 3</l>
					<l>Weeks when as Sitting alone in my Room, our Savr presented himself to</l>
					<l>my Heart in his bleeding Wounded Form, &amp; brought me into such a converse</l>
					<l>with his own dear person, as I had never known before, then it was that</l>
					<l>my heart went over to Him, then I was willing to live any where, or be any</l>
					<l>Thing what might be most pleasing to him. His Blood his Death &amp; Almigh</l>
					<l>by Atonement has since that blest Intercouse, remaind my neverfailing</l>
					<l>Source of Comfort &amp; Consolation, in all Trials &amp; Vicissitudes whatsoever.</l>
					<l>his Wounds &amp; bitter Passion, his Death was my confession, &amp; shall be</l>
					<l>till my Eye-Strings break. The Bre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> rejoied much at my return to</l>
					<l>London at all the Grace our dear Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> had bestowed on me. In June 1742</l>
					<l>my Father having departed this Life,  I went by the Direction of the</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Bre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> to the Childrens Oeconomy in Lambs-Inn, where I</l>
					<l>lived with the bigger Girls. Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 29<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> I returnd to London, &amp; on the</l>
					<l>30<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> of the some Instant, that ever memorable day, I was present at the</l>
					<l>settling of the London Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>: what we felt at that time I suppose will by</l>
					<l>no Body be forgot who was there till beyond the Grave, I thought, this is</l>
					<l>none other but the House of God, &amp; here are the Gates of Heaven! There</l>
					<l>I got my incontestable Call, to be visibly united to that Body. on</l>
					<l>the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> day next following, I was rec&apos;d (viz) on Christmass Day </l>
					<l>1743, &amp; had the Favour of being admitted to the <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Sacrament</hi> next follow</l>
					<l>ing Sacrament, which I think to have been Jan. 1743.</l>
					<l>I assisted in the Labour amongst the Single Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> in London according</l>
					<l>to my Small abillity till June 1743 where I was sent by the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> into</l>
					<l>Yorkshire, to have the joint Care of the Single Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Choir there with</l>
					<l>my Sister Susanna &amp; Sister Lloid. In June 1744 I was blest for the</l>
					<l>Office of Vorestehr of the said Choir, &amp; in Aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> following, I rec&apos;d the</l>
					<l>blessing for the office I afterwards held amongst the Single Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi>, during</l>
					<l>every anointed Prayer of Bror Martin Dobers. In that situation I continued</l>
					<l>till my state of health render&apos;d me incapable of serving my dear Sisters</l>
					<l>as I had hithertoo done; I then sent my Petitions to dear Mammagen</l>
					<l>&amp; Anna Johanna to send a Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> from Germany to supply my Place</l>
					<l>which was at length granted in the year 1748 to the entire satisfac</l>
					<l>tion of my Heart. I laid down my Office at our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Feet with</l>
					<l>more Inclination than I had at first to receive it, being now more unable to fulfill it yet awefully con</l>
					<l>ciding how he might have look&apos;d upon my poor services; and if his</l>
					<l>Heart cou&apos;d upon the whole be satisfied with them? His friendly Counte</l>
					<l>nance cheard me, I begd his absolation for all my Faults Failings,</l>
					<l>&amp; Mistakes, &amp; thus with a throughly comforted &amp; contented Heart I</l>
					<l>enterd into my wish&apos;d for Sabbatick State, I was desirious to go to</l>
					<l>the then now settled Oeconomy at little-moor, hopeing a charge of air</l>
					<l>might be of Service to me where I continued near a year, &amp; realy</l>
					<l>did grow a little better, having rec&apos;d a Letter from my dear Mammagen</l>
					<l>(who was not quite satisfied with my betakeing any self wholy to sick</l>
					<l>ness &amp; Retirement) wherein she mentiond in the most loving &amp; kind</l>
					<l>manner, that she shou&apos;d like to have me go to Duckenfield &amp; do what</l>
					<l>I could amongst the Single Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> there: I laid the matter before our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, &amp; found that notwithstanding the seeming Impossibillity of my</l>
					<l>performing the Journey, my heart was never easey, but when I thought</l>
					<l>of going: thus I came to a Resolution, &amp; having had a blessed Journey</l>
					<l>I arrived there May 1749: from whence I return&apos;d with the whole</l>
					<l>Oeconomy of Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Sept<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 29<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1750. The Bre<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> favour&apos;d me</l>
					<l>with one of the Houses on Lambs-Hill, where I lived</l>
					<l>chearful &amp; contented only in an exceeding poor state of Health</l>
					<l>till Feb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ry</hi> 27<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1753 when I come into the dear Choir-House.</l>
