					<l>Mary Elizabeth Thornton</l>
					<l>was born on the 16<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> of December</l>
					<l>1831 in the little village of Tong</l>
					<l>At the age of about four years the</l>
					<l>learned to read with great facility,</l>
					<l>and indeed began early to give indi</l>
					<l>cations of an ardent thirst for knowledge</l>
					<l>and intense delight in reading.</l>
					<l>Half a year afterwards her parents</l>
					<l>removed to Fulnec, but previously</l>
					<l>to that she had lodged there with</l>
					<l>some several kind friends, that she might</l>
					<l>have the benefit of the day schools.</l>
					<l>For seven years she remained there,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>though not attending school regularly, as</l>
					<l>her mother required her assistance in</l>
					<l>the household duties.</l>
					<l>The pleasure she seemed to feel in her</l>
					<l>studies while at school, and the</l>
					<l>progress she made during that</l>
					<l>short period, together with her affec</l>
					<l>tion for teachers &amp; companions, were</l>
					<l>gratifying proofs to her dear parents</l>
					<l>that she was under the fixed influ</l>
					<l>ence of correct principles, in endea</l>
					<l>vouring to redeem the time she</l>
					<l>felt of so great value.</l>
					<l>In her 16<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year she went to</l>
					<l>Bootle where she remained for 7</l>
					<l>months, but owing to her health</l>
					<l>&amp; the removal of the family to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>London she was obliged to return</l>
					<l>home. While there the enjoyed</l>
					<l>the Society of a Christian minister</l>
					<l>of the established Church, of whom</l>
					<l>she often spoke &amp; from those conver</l>
					<l>aations ahe derived great benefit.</l>
					<l>Her health improving, she went to</l>
					<l>Lancashire, but as in the course</l>
					<l>of a few months, a change seemed</l>
					<l>desirable both by her parents &amp;</l>
					<l>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Miller, the latter took her</l>
					<l>into his own house, where she</l>
					<l>remained about a year &amp; nine</l>
					<l>months.</l>
					<l>During her stay in Salem, she</l>
					<l>experienced much blessing, by</l>
					<l>occasion of her reception into the</l>
					<l>Church (of Christ) by the rite</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of confirmation.</l>
					<l>Though we were not with her at the</l>
					<l>time, the remembrance she left be</l>
					<l>hind her with a few friends, leads us</l>
					<l>to believe that there existed a feeling</l>
					<l>of Christian fellowship between her</l>
					<l>and the little flock in Salem, with</l>
					<l>which she was connected, which affords a</l>
					<l>pleasing recollection to her sorrowing</l>
					<l>relations.</l>
					<l>Owing to circumstances her return</l>
					<l>home was thought desirable by her</l>
					<l>parents, she having a large</l>
					<l>family also required her assistance</l>
					<l>Beautiful instances might be</l>
					<l>given of her now chastened delight</l>
					<l>in the society of her parents &amp;</l>
					<l>friends, and her deep solitude</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>for the wellfare of her brothers &amp;</l>
					<l>sisters. The Sabbath services</l>
					<l>were enjoyed with a keener relish,</l>
					<l>never had home been so sweet, or did the</l>
					<l>wishes of her parents meet with</l>
					<l>such a warm response, as at this time,</l>
					<l>for it was her delight, to do everything</l>
					<l>in her power to assist them in their</l>
					<l>various duties, as long as her</l>
					<l>health would permit.</l>
					<l>In December 1853 she took</l>
					<l>violent cold &amp;  cough, which never</l>
					<l>left her, but gradually brought</l>
					<l>to the lingering diseaze which</l>
					<l>terminated her life</l>
					<l>Owing to the particular nature of her</l>
					<l>complaint, she always entertained the</l>
					<l>hope that she was better which her</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>friends were always glad to admit,</l>
					<l>as they wished it to be so, as much</l>
					<l>as she herself did. But finding</l>
					<l>it was the Lords will that she should</l>
					<l>not be restored, it was pleasing to</l>
					<l>see her calm resignation to Him,</l>
					<l>who she said &quot;did all things well.&quot;</l>
					<l>She was many times asked during her</l>
					<l>illness, if she could resign herself to</l>
					<l>the Lords will, whether He should</l>
					<l>take her or restore her, but she</l>
					<l>always replied that she tried to do</l>
					<l>so, &amp; being naturally of a reserved</l>
					<l>disposition, her friends took it for</l>
					<l>granted that she did so, and her</l>
					<l>calm &amp; happy death afforded a</l>
					<l>sufficient proof. A few evenings</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>before her departure, her little</l>
					<l>brother having gone in to bid her</l>
					<l>good night, she asked him if he</l>
					<l>prayed to our Savior to take her to</l>
					<l>himself, when he innocently replied</l>
					<l>&quot;yes,&quot; and she appeared quite pleased</l>
					<l>that he did so.</l>
					<l>The day before she died her father</l>
					<l>read the texts, and the passage for</l>
					<l>the day, from Bogatzky&apos;s Golden</l>
					<l>Treasury, and the verses attached to</l>
					<l>them were &quot;Let me but hear my</l>
					<l>Savior say, - Strength shall be</l>
					<l>equal to thy day, - Then I re</l>
					<l>joice in deep distress, - Leaning</l>
					<l>on all sufficient grace -</l>
					<l>I glory infirmity, - That</l>
					<l>Christ&apos;s own power may rest on me,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>When I am week, then I am strong.</l>
					<l>Grace is my shield &amp; Christ my song.</l>
					<l>On hearing these, she exclaimed,</l>
					<l>Oh! <hi rend='underlined:true;'>that</hi> is enough for me!</l>
					<l>On the day she died her brothers &amp;</l>
					<l>sisters were called into her room</l>
					<l>at her request, that she might</l>
					<l>take leave of them which she did</l>
					<l>in a manner that will not easily</l>
					<l>be chased from their memory.</l>
					<l>A short time before she expired, she</l>
					<l>requested her friends to sing for her</l>
					<l>the hymn, &quot;For ever with the Lord&quot;</l>
					<l>Being very anxious to have it sung,</l>
					<l>she began herself &amp; joined in the</l>
					<l>singing of the whole hymn as well</l>
					<l>as she was able. When it was con</l>
					<l>cluded, she wished the evening</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>hymn to be sung during which she</l>
					<l>sank into unconscious stumber, and</l>
					<l>we believe sweetly fell asleep in</l>
					<l>Jesus.</l>
					<l>From this brief narrative drawn up</l>
					<l>by her relations it is evident that our</l>
					<l>late Sister was acquainted with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>&amp; that the instructions she received in</l>
					<l>Childhood were blessed to her soul.</l>
					<l>The time of her residence in Salem espec</l>
					<l>ially in the family of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Miller was</l>
					<l>in important period of her life for then</l>
					<l>the Lord opened her heart that she</l>
					<l>attended to the things that make for our</l>
					<l>peace. On her return home about</l>
					<l>4 years ago, and for some time after,</l>
					<l>she showed an humble teachable spirit</l>
					<l>and an eager desire for spiritual conversation.</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Latterly tho&apos; her conduct was always</l>
					<l>correct, she did not evince the same</l>
					<l>openheartedness, and that desire after</l>
					<l>spiritual food, which caused an anxious</l>
					<l>fear on her account, that a spiritual</l>
					<l>decline had taken place, and that the</l>
					<l>world was drawing her aside from the</l>
					<l>simplicity of Christ.</l>
					<l>Of this she herself spoke in the latter</l>
					<l>days of her life, and sorrowed over the</l>
					<l>sad effects of remisness in watchfulness</l>
					<l>&amp; prayer.</l>
					<l>This together with her naturally very</l>
					<l>reserved disposition, made it difficult</l>
					<l>at first to draw her out into conver</l>
					<l>sation on the state of her heart.</l>
					<l>She clung to life and from the flattering</l>
					<l>nature of her complaint, she cherished</l>
					<l>the hope of recovery till within a few</l>
					<l>weeks of her dissolution, ever after it</l>
					<l>was apparent to her friends from her</l>
					<l>increasing weakness that she would not</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>recover.</l>
					<l>Latterly she shared a greater desire</l>
					<l>after spiritual conversation &amp; and reading</l>
					<l>and desired that prayer should be offered</l>
					<l>up in her room. Once she said, &quot;I often</l>
					<l>reflect on what you day, tho&apos; I cannot</l>
					<l>express my feelings, &amp; when I lift my</l>
					<l>heart up to our Savior, he meets me.&quot;</l>
					<l>On Saturday 7<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> she expressed</l>
					<l>a strong desire once more to enjoy the</l>
					<l>holy Communion and said &quot;now I</l>
					<l>have given up the hope of being able to</l>
					<l>go to Chapel &amp; I should feel it a favour</l>
					<l>to have it administered in my room.&quot;</l>
					<l>On that occasion she spoke freely</l>
					<l>of the state of her heart, and expressed</l>
					<l>a wish that any the most searching</l>
					<l>question should be put to her, as she felt</l>
					<l>the great importance of being prepared</l>
					<l>What she said, confirmed the hope</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='7'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>we had entertained, that Jesus was not an</l>
					<l>unknown Saviour to her - and, that the</l>
					<l>way of peace &amp; happiness thro&apos; faith in his</l>
					<l>blood, was one in which she had walked.</l>
					<l>Yet a mist seemed to hang over her path </l>
					<l>and she had not a cheerful bright prospect.</l>
					<l>Knowing that she had forsaken the Lord &amp;</l>
					<l>grieved his holy Spirit, she felt confused &amp;</l>
					<l>afraid. The confidence of faith</l>
					<l>had left her, &amp; like many others she was</l>
					<l>looking for the evidences of her justifications</l>
					<l>in her own feelings, and expecting to see</l>
					<l>these before she could lay hold of the hope</l>
					<l>of the Gospel. Looking for the fruits be</l>
					<l>fore the branch was grafted into the vine</l>
					<l>or the tree planted.</l>
					<l>Being directed to turn to our Saviour</l>
					<l>just as she felt and assured of his mercy &amp;</l>
					<l>readiness to forgive &amp; to heal our backslidings</l>
					<l>her mind was much comforted. The texts</l>
					<l>of Scripture that were repeated were blessed</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='8'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>by the holy spirit to her soul. These</l>
					<l>were the words of Jesus, I am the resurrection</l>
					<l>&amp; the life he that believeth in me, etc</l>
					<l>and I am he that liveth &amp; was dead and</l>
					<l>behold I am etc and I have set</l>
					<l>before thee an open door etc.</l>
					<l>These texts and this conversation she referred</l>
					<l>to several times in the following week and</l>
					<l>wished the texts to be read.</l>
					<l>On Sunday 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> was</l>
					<l>administered to her &amp; the family in presence</l>
					<l>of a  few friends. It proved a great re</l>
					<l>freshment to her and tho&apos; the service</l>
					<l>had as we feared, exhausted her, yet she was</l>
					<l>able to take the air in the evening her</l>
					<l>dear father driving her out in a gig.</l>
					<l>But this proved the last time of her leaving</l>
					<l>the sick chamber. The following</l>
					<l>night she became much worse, difficulty</l>
					<l>of breathing came on, &amp; she had a restless</l>
					<l>night. But the following day she was</l>
					<l>cheerful &amp; composed and spoke with joy</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='9'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of the prospect of going home  saying</l>
					<l>&quot;I have no fear. I can give all up Jesus</l>
					<l>will receive me.&quot;</l>
					<l>On Tuesday however her mind was</l>
					<l>not so composed, and what she said led us</l>
					<l>to see, that the H. Ghost was deepening</l>
					<l>his own work on her heart, probing the</l>
					<l>wounds and showing her more of her</l>
					<l>own vileness, that he might thus prepare</l>
					<l>her for richer displays of the Grace of Jesus.</l>
					<l>On Friday morning the writer of</l>
					<l>this witnessed a scene of the most solemn</l>
					<l>&amp; affecting nature. The dear patient felt</l>
					<l>that the time of her departure was</l>
					<l>drawing nigh and desired to see &amp;</l>
					<l>take leave of all the family.</l>
					<l>With composure of mind she gave each of</l>
					<l>her brothers &amp; sisters words of admonition,</l>
					<l>that retrust will not be lost or forgotten.</l>
					<l>Earnestly did she exhort them to love our</l>
					<l>Saviour to walk in his ways, that they</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>might all meet again in heaven.</l>
					<l>After this with upfolded hands, she com</l>
					<l>mended them in prayer to our Saviour and</l>
					<l>was heard in broken accents saying &quot;dear</l>
					<l>Savior bless them&quot; bless all and bless all</l>
					<l>my kind friends who have been so kind to</l>
					<l>me bless them O Jesus!&quot;</l>
					<l>It was good to be there for the</l>
					<l>presence of Jesus was powerfully felt</l>
					<l>of this the dear patient testified saying</l>
					<l>&quot;I feel his nearness. I am his he is mine</l>
					<l>he will not leave me.&quot;</l>
					<l>At her request we then sung a few verses</l>
					<l>in which she joined, expressive of the</l>
					<l>happiness of the redeemed around the</l>
					<l>throne. And having in prayer commended</l>
					<l>her departing spirit of Jesus the blessing</l>
					<l>the Lord has imparted to her she joined</l>
					<l>in the singing of the words &quot;In the name</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='10'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of Jesus. Amen!</l>
					<l>In the afterpart of the day she revived a</l>
					<l>little till about 11 O&apos;Clock at night</l>
					<l>when a change was perceptible.</l>
					<l>She requested that some verse might</l>
					<l>be sung &amp; selected them herself and</l>
					<l>was so collected &amp; interested in the service,</l>
					<l>that once the began the tune, and corrected</l>
					<l>her dear father who had read a word</l>
					<l>wrong. The concluding verses of the</l>
					<l>hymn sung were we believe expressive</l>
					<l>of the state of her mind, and of the bliss</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>ha</hi> she now enjoys.</l>
					<l>125 Ps - v  7- 10</l>
					<l>&quot;For ever with the Lord!&quot; etc.</l>
