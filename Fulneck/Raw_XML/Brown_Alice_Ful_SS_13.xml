					<l>Our Dear Departed Sr Alice Brown; was borne at Ashton</l>
					<l>in Lancashire, on April ye 23d in ye year 1730</l>
					<l>from a child She was never without Convictions, and as soon ye</l>
					<l>Brethren came to Duckenfield, She was one ye &amp; first Children wich was</l>
					<l>takes under ye Brns care, ye tender Longing of her heart is become truly acquaintd</l>
					<l>with our Saviour, and to know for her own individual; her Grace of Election in ye</l>
					<l>Wounds of Jesus, was plainly felt and seen in all his Actions; She Us&apos;d</l>
					<l>often to go alone by her Self, in to the fields, and when she Could get in to a</l>
					<l>privet place prostrated her self on ye ground, before our Saviour, beging him</l>
					<l>for his Death and Bloods Sake, to bestow upon her, that happiness, and</l>
					<l>full pardon in his Wounds, which she felt, as belived was to be attaind</l>
					<l>to; even wile in this Body, in this sittuation She went on, till she had obtaind</l>
					<l>what her heart wanted; of this blest course of Grace, which our Saviour</l>
					<l>begun with her wile a Child; She Us&apos;d afterwards to relate with</l>
					<l>plesuer; and it always came from her with such a tender felling, that </l>
					<l>Who ever heard her speak thereof Could not but be Sencably back&apos;d,</l>
					<l>In ye Year 1744  She left her Parents, and lived with her three</l>
					<l>Brothers and two Sisters, Who on account of their Mother, being</l>
					<l>at that time of a different way of thinking from them, had taken a</l>
					<l>house them Selves; in order to follow their Course with ye Brethren</l>
					<l>more to their own Satisfaction, she lived thus about half a year</l>
					<l>and then she with her two Sister, and a few more, made ye begining</l>
					<l>of a little Oeconomy, which lasted about a year and half, when on some</l>
					<l>Ocations, it was thought fit for that House-keeping to be broke up,</l>
					<l>And such had it propos&apos;d to them, to go to their homes again,</l>
					<l>This proved a great grife, to our depated Sister, and She with her Christ</l>
					<l>Sister Resolve&apos;d not to go back to their parents, but to live together</l>
					<l>till our Saviour Should see fit to make out some way for them, which</l>
					<l>Accordingly happen&apos;d, that very year, When Brother, and Sister</l>
					<l>Hackenwelter came thither, Who Approved him self as a faithful</l>
					<l>Father in helping ye Sisters, as far as lay in his Power, and Capability</l>
					<l>our Departed Sister; whome they Look&apos;d upon as their own Child in all</l>
					<l>this time, our Saviour carried on his Work of Grace in her heart, in a manner</l>
					<l>not to be discribed, but which at ye same time was very Decernable to all</l>
					<l>who knew her,</l>
					<l>April ye 23d 1748 She was Recived in to ye Congregation,</l>
					<l>and on Augst ye 13th in ye same year She was made a partaker of ye</l>
					<l>Corpess and blood of Jesus; in ye holy Sacrament,</l>
					<l>Altho&apos; she was Naturaly of a very still disposition, yet Concerning</l>
					<l>her own heart, and ye Acquaintens with our Saviour She Cou&apos;d say enouf:</l>
					<l>for, as soon as any one, begun in this subject, She never was Silent</l>
					<l>but was always ready to relate, our Saviours works of Grace in her heart</l>
					<l>Which from time to time, through his most Nearness, was carried on in her</l>
					<l>further then any Human Eye could penatrate, and past (unclear)</l>
					<l>so that when She in a Childlike manner spoke something thereof it made</l>
					<l>her fellow Sisters mealt in (unclear) Shame,</l>

					<l>Chearfull, and Sinnerlike heart, thankfull, for her happy lot of grace</l>
					<l>to be so closly, United with our Saviours Congregation, which She</l>
					<l>pris&apos;d very highly</l>
					<l>When ye Hundred, was Setled here, She was one which was recived into</l>
					<l>that Number</l>
					<l>I ye Year 1753 2 She removed in to ye Choir-house with ye rest</l>
					<l>of ye Sisters, at which She rejoiced, very much, for ye Liveing in a</l>
					<l>Choir-house, was to her every waty matter, for her Choir was very dear</l>
					<l>to her, and one can with trueth, Give her ye testimony, that She was</l>

					<l>blessed Choier, Lord-supper; She was also one of that Number</l>
					<l>for this Long time past, She has talkd very much of going home</l>
					<l>And said She, I can&apos;t not help beliveing that my time would not</l>
					<l>be long in this World, on her last birth-day She got a particular</l>
					<l>intimation from our Saviour, Consorneing thiss, since which</l>
					<l>time, She has often told ye Sister you will see, I shall go home before</l>
					<l>my next birth-day, for I have beg&apos;d our Saviour to take me</l>
					<l>home thiss year and I also belive he surely will, She has for</l>
					<l>some time past, Complaind very much of a pain in her head</l>
					<l>which never Left her, but continued to grow worse, and tis</l>
					<l>Strenthend her belive, that she should soon be with our Saviour</l>
					<l>On July ye 22d She enterd ye Sick room, when ye disonder in</l>
					<l>her head, began to grow very Voilen,</l>
					<l>ye 25th She began to Sing, have no mind for Eating or for drinking</l>
					<l>Food, which must Corrupt again &amp;c</l>
					<l>And many such like Versses, which showd planly the Longing of her</l>
					<l>heart to be at home; altho her pains which she felt, was very great</l>
					<l>yet when She recoverd, her Self a little, She was so brisk and Chearfull</l>
					<l>and would talk with ye Sisters in Such on agreable manner, that</l>
					<l>it was a pleasuer, to be with her her disorder lying so much in her</l>
					<l>head, we thought it proper to keep her still as possable, it was there for</l>
					<l>desired that ye Sister would go but of Little in to ye</l>
					<l>Sick-room, which when She percived, made her very much</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>dissatisfied, and She desired that ye Sisters might not</l>
					<l>be kept from comeing to see her, becose it made the time much</l>
					<l>pleasent&apos;er to her when ye Sisters was with her.</l>
					<l>She desired that She might once more be brought into her Liveing</l>
					<l>Room, which was done, this pleasd her very much, She desired we would</l>
					<l>Sing her some Verses, for going home, which was done under such a</l>
					<l>sencable felling, of ye Nearness of our Saviour, and with an inward</l>
					<l>loning of our hearts, to be at home with him; which made our Eyes over flow</l>
					<l>with tears, we could scarcely perswade her to let us take her in to</l>
					<l>ye Sick-room again, but being affraid She would spend her self to</l>
					<l>and we beg&apos;d her Now to take her Leave, then She desired us to</l>
					<l>concluded, with that Vers, Love, who death for me endured, &amp;c.</l>
					<l>in a few days after, She desired to see her Class, once more together</l>
					<l>When ye Sisters had made ye Love-feast ready they brought her</l>
					<l>into ye Room, at which She was so lively and Chearfull, that She</l>
					<l>did not seem like a Sick-person; so that we Could have almost</l>
					<l>belive, She might rely recover again; we put it to her, if She Still</l>
					<l>realy thought of Leveing us; She said, She could not tell, but her</l>
					<l>Choice, wou&apos;d be to go home, but when I consider it rightly, what</l>
					<l>A time that will be, when I come to our Saviour, the favour seems</l>
					<l>to great; we then Askd her, if She did go home whome She would</l>
					<l>fetch ye first She then Namd a Sister, we then Ask&apos;d why her in</l>
					<l>perticuler? She said becose I belive She will be ye first of this company</l>
					<l>And then we will fetch all ye rest, one after a nother; I have often told</l>
					<l>you that when I come to our Saviour, I will not forget one in this house,</l>
					<l>this She took leve of her Class, and went again in to ye Sick-room</l>
					<l>She continued for some time, better then ever we had seen, her since</l>
					<l>in ye Sick-room, so that She her Self, began to believe, She might</l>
					<l>mend again, but in a short time, her pain returnd rather worse</l>
					<l>then ever,</l>
					<l>On ye 8 of Augst She got a fainting fit, we us&apos;d mens to bring her</l>
					<l>to her Self again, when She Opend her Eyes and saw ye Sisters, She</l>
					<l>Smild, and said, Ay! are you come to Lay me out, why did you not</l>

					<l>it seemd as if She thought of going soon, but we percived</l>
					<l>No alteration in her; for the several day She has not been able</l>
