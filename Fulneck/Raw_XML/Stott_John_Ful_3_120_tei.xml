					<l>March / 44</l>
					<l>Our late B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> J<hi rend='superscript:true;'>o.</hi> Stott jur. was</l>
					<l>born at Lane-end or Bankhouse hill</l>
					<l>Jan. 26<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th.</hi> 1798 &amp; baptised a few days</l>
					<l>afterwards in our Chapel, his parents</l>
					<l>being then, as they still are (for they</l>
					<l>are both living) members of our ch.</l>
					<l>From his childhood it would ap</l>
					<l>pear the H. Sp<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi>. operated graciously</l>
					<l>in his heart, for he was always</l>
					<l>seriously disposed, a pleasant son</l>
					<l>&amp; maintained, in youth &amp; maturity</l>
					<l>a sturdy character. After his marriage</l>
					<l>24 or 25 yrs. ago, he became a com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi></l>
					<l>member of the church in which he</l>
					<l>was born &amp; bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> up. About 4 yrs</l>
					<l>ago his mind was a good deal harassed</l>
					<l>&amp; depressed by a circumstance, for</l>
					<l>which neither he nor any one, here was</l>
					<l>to blame, but which involved him to </l>
					<l>an amount very large for our</l>
					<l>us his circumstances of life; in debt</l>
					<l>??? Lord blessed &amp; his wife partner&apos;s</l>
					<l>honest endeavours to discharge all</l>
					<l>claims upon them; yet the fear</l>
					<l>of bringing disgrace upon his fami</l>
					<l>ly &amp; his Christian profession so affected</l>
					<l>his mind, that it is not improba</l>
					<l>ble, the epileptic fits to which he</l>
					<l>was thenceforward subject, were the</l>
				</lg>
			</p>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>brought on. From that time his</l>
					<l>life was very precarious &amp; he was</l>
					<l>well aware of it &amp; he appeared to have</l>
					<l>sought, with increasing earnestness,</l>
					<l>to make his calling &amp; election ???</l>
					<l>he loved the house of God &amp; would fre</l>
					<l>quently say to his friends &amp; rela</l>
					<l>tives, how much good the saviour had</l>
					<l>been the means of doing his soul</l>
					<l>&amp; he would doubtless have been a</l>
					<l>more frequent attendant in the</l>
					<l>Lords courts, had he not been de</l>
					<l>terred by the fear of causing alarm</l>
					<l>or disturbance, if he should be seized</l>
					<l>in the Chapel, as actually was the</l>
					<l>case on one occasion; as it was,</l>
					<l>however, he was frequently seen</l>
					<l>among those who went up to the</l>
					<l>house of the Lord.</l>
					<l>He was frequently known to retire</l>
					<l>for the purpose of prayer, &amp;, we hope,</l>
					<l>was habitually watching for that</l>
					<l>coming of his Lord, which he knew</l>
					<l>must &amp; would be sudden. The evening</l>
					<l>before his death, being asked by a</l>
					<l>friend, how he was in health, he re</l>
					<l>plied, &quot;I am very well; but I have</l>
					<l>not a minunte to call my own;&quot;</l>
					<l>meaning, doubtless, that he might</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>be taken at a moment&apos;s warning.</l>
					<l>Of late the fits seem to have been</l>
					<l>more frequent, &amp; he always fell down</l>
					<l>in a moment utterly unconscious.</l>
					<l>Last Saturday morn<hi rend='superscript:true;'>g</hi>. he went, un</l>
					<l>known to his wife, between 7 &amp; 8</l>
					<l>a.m. to the well called Bank-house</l>
					<l>well to fetch water, where he was</l>
					<l>no doubt seized with one of the</l>
					<l>fits while standing by the winch</l>
					<l>of this well, fell into it, &amp; was</l>
					<l>very soon drowned. tho&apos; the well is</l>
					<l>not 3 feet deep, &amp; he had not been</l>
					<l>above 1/4 of an hour absent from </l>
					<l>his house. All means were tried</l>
					<l>in vain to restore animation; his</l>
					<l>spirit had fled to God who gave</l>
					<l>it, &amp; who saw fit to call him</l>
					<l>home in this mysterious &amp; striking</l>
					<l>way. That well, then, was a well</l>
					<l>of death to him; but we trust there</l>
					<l>was in him a well of living water,</l>
					<l>the flowing of which was not stopped</l>
					<l>by the cold waters of that fountains,</l>
					<l>but which rather, at that moment</l>
					<l>sprang up with eternal life; for</l>
					<l>our late B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> believed &amp; put his whole</l>
					<l>trust in that Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, whom to know is</l>
					<l>life eternal &amp; who giveth living</l>
					<l>water to all that ask of Him. Our</l>

					<l>late Br. was 46 years old,  &amp; has left</l>
					<l>a widow &amp; 6 children to deplar his</l>
