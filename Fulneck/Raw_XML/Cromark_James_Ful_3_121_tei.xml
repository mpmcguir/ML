					<l>Feb. /44</l>
					<l>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> James Cromark born at</l>
					<l>??? in Jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> 1767 &amp; baptised in the</l>
					<l>Ch of Engld, but his father joining</l>
					<l>the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> soon afterwards he bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> his chil</l>
					<l>dren regularly with him to our chapel</l>
					<l>?? also that ??? (he knew the truth) from</l>
					<l>our souls childhood, &amp; was made ac</l>
					<l>quainted with the people among whom</l>
					<l>he subsequently cast in his lot. When</l>
					<l>12 or 13 yrs. of age he was put appren</l>
					<l>tice to clothier of the name of Mir</l>
					<l>field of <unclear>Green??</unclear> Pudsey whose wife</l>
					<l>was also a member of our choir</l>
					<l>so that he had still attended the</l>
					<l>means of Grace here. Some yrs</l>
					<l>after his apprenticeship termina</l>
					<l>ted he marr<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> his present widow &amp; in</l>
					<l>1798 they were both added to our</l>
					<l>Society &amp; afterwards rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> into the</l>
					<l>Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; admitted to the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi></l>
					<l>together, &amp; have ever since remain</l>
					<l>ed attached &amp; faithful members.</l>
					<l>The good deed of the word was early</l>
					<l>sown in our late B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> heart so that his</l>
					<l>understanding was enlightened, his</l>
					<l>conscience made tender &amp; his heart in</l>
					<l>clined to fear Gods, &amp; hence his con</l>
					<l>duct was never, even in his youth</l>
					<l>loose or immoral; on the other hand</l>
					<l>he always shunned evil company</l>
					<l>&amp; maintained a good character. It was</l>
					<l>however under the ministry of the late</l>

					<l>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> John <unclear>Hartley</unclear> that both he &amp; his ???</l>
					<l>ner were incited to devote themselves</l>
					<l>unreservedly to their Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; to seek</l>
					<l>fellowship with a Xtian Church &amp;</l>
					<l>they joined our the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> because they</l>
					<l>felt themselves divinely called to</l>
					<l>it. During the 46 yrs. that our</l>
					<l>late B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> has gone in &amp; out among</l>
					<l>us, we saw in him the testimony</l>
					<l>that he walked humbly with his God</l>
					<l>that his faith was simple &amp; childlike</l>
					<l>&amp; no doubt his heart was purified</l>
					<l>by means of that faith for it wrought</l>
					<l>by love - the love of God shed abroad in</l>
					<l>his heart by the H. Ghost,  for &amp; he evi</l>
					<l>dently loved both the Lord, &amp; his people.</l>
					<l>He made no ostentatious display of</l>
					<l>his piety, was a quiet, retiring</l>
					<l>unobtrusive character &amp; a man of</l>
					<l>few words; but that he had experien</l>
					<l>ced grace &amp; lived in communion with</l>
					<l>the Friend of his soul was manifest</l>
					<l>from his whole conduct &amp; spirit;</l>
					<l>when he <hi rend='underlined:true;'>did</hi> speak on spiritual</l>
					<l>matters, his words tho&apos; few, were to the</l>
					<l>point &amp; particularly during his</l>
					<l>last illness, when the love of Christ a crucified Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>displayed to &amp; in <hi rend='underlined:true;'>him</hi>, a poor sinner</l>
					<l>was the subject. his eyes might be</l>
					<l>seen suffused with tears. His charac</l>

					<l>ter was such, that he was beloved by</l>
					<l>his family (&amp; especially his children,</l>
					<l>whom he &amp; his partner strove to bring</l>
					<l>up in the nurture &amp; admonition of</l>
					<l>the Lord, &amp; that Lord blessed their exen-??</l>
					<l>tions &amp; heard their prayers) &amp; respec</l>
					<l>ted by all that knew him.</l>
					<l>4 or 5 months ago he fell ill of the</l>
					<l>jaundice, &amp; tho&apos; he seemed to get over</l>
					<l><hi rend='underlined:true;'>that</hi> disease, dropsical symptoms</l>
					<l>appeared in his legs, which after re</l>
					<l>maining stationary for some time,</l>
					<l>began to spread rapidly about a fort</l>
					<l>night ago, &amp; compelled him to take</l>
					<l>almost entirely to his bed. He seems</l>
					<l>to have apprehended his approaching</l>
					<l>dissolution from the first, but was</l>
					<l>perfectly resigned to his divine Master&apos;s</l>
					<l>will. he was always found cheerful</l>
					<l>when visited, humbly yet confident</l>
					<l>ly trusting in our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; only desi</l>
					<l>rous to be made ready for his</l>
					<l>coming. Last week he felt some</l>
					<l>what gloomy &amp; doubts &amp; fears some rather</l>
					<l>what harassed him, probably no doubt in con</l>
					<l>sequence of bodily pain &amp; increasing</l>
					<l>debility; yet in the under of all he</l>
					<l>told his wife he knew it was but a</l>
					<l>transient season of distress &amp; for that</l>
					<l>his Redeemer would comfort &amp; assure</l>
					<l>him again. Last Friday I called</l>

					<l>upon him &amp; administered to him the</l>
					<l>consolations, which are calculated so abundantly to</l>
					<l>cheer &amp; strengthen a child of God, when</l>
					<l>walking thro&apos; the valley of the shadow of</l>
					<l> death, reminding him of the many sweet</l>
					<l>&amp; precious promises given to the afflicted</l>
					<l>believer &amp; above all, of the <hi rend='underlined:true;'>all suffering</hi></l>
					<l>of Him, in whom he had believed the <hi rend='underlined:true;'>all</hi></l>
					<l><hi rend='underlined:true;'>ataining</hi> virtue of His blood the perfectness</l>
					<l>of his righteousness, of his being so ten</l>
					<l>derly compassionate a high-priest, </l>
					<l>of His being Jesus Christ same yesterday </l>
					<l>to-day &amp; for ever. These precious truths</l>
					<l>&amp; promises served to revive his spirit</l>
					<l>&amp; I then commended him in fervant</l>
					<l>prayer to the mercies of his God &amp; Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>.</l>
					<l>He assured me, before I left him, that he</l>
					<l>felt much comforted, the tears meantime</l>
					<l>trickling down his cheeks. Indeed, he re</l>
					<l>mained cheerful to the end, &amp; told his</l>
					<l>partners, not long before he died, that he</l>
					<l>was perfectly tranquil &amp; happy in his</l>
					<l>mind, full of confidence in the Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi></l>
					<l>&amp; longing to depart &amp; to be with Xt!</l>
					<l>He fell asleep in Jesus without a</l>
					<l>struggle or a groan, on Tuesday morn </l>
					<l>last ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> 5 a.m., aged 77 years.</l>
					<l>He had 10 child<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, 5 of whom have pre</l>
					<l>ceded him into eternity, &amp; 25 grand</l>
					<l>children, most of whom are still living</l>
					<l>&amp; many of them scholars in our Sun</l>
					<l>day School. May the Lord give them all</l>
					<l>grace to follow in their father&apos;s or grandfa</l>
					<l>ther, as far as he followed Xt. &amp; visbly</l>
					<l>comfort &amp; graciously guide &amp; sustain our</l>
					<l>d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Sister, his aged &amp; afflicted widow!</l>
