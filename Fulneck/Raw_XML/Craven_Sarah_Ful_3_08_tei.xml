					<l>The Life of the Single Sister Sar<hi rend='superscript:true;'>h</hi> Craven who departed</l>
					<l>in Fulneck Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 10<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1790.</l>
					<l>I was born at Rothwel near Leeds in Yorkshire Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r:</hi> 11<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1719 and</l>
					<l>Liv&apos;d with my Parents till my Father died who belong&apos;d to the </l>
					<l>Church of England. When I was a Child I often wish&apos;d to die, for</l>
					<l>I thought at that age I shou&apos;d be saved; but if I liv&apos;d to grow</l>
					<l>up to be a Woman I should come into things which would hinder</l>
					<l>me from attaining eternal happiness. When I came into riper</l>
					<l>years I follow&apos;d the World with eagerness, tho not with satisfaction</l>
					<l>for I often felt uneasy in my mind, but put it off, resolving to</l>
					<l>grow better, but still went on in my old way. After my Father&apos;s</l>
					<l>death I went to live with my Uncle, and was with him when M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Ingham came into those parts, but soon after went to live with my</l>
					<l>Mother: she ask&apos;d me to go with her to hear him Preach, but I</l>
					<l>declin&apos;d it for this reason, I believ&apos;d if I was one of his followers</l>
					<l>I must renounce the World; which was my cheif Object at that time</l>
					<l>Soon after he came again to preach nearer to our habittution; my</l>
					<l>Mother urged me to go with her which I could not help complying with</l>
					<l>tho, spiritually dead, and the discourse had no effect, and I wonder&apos;d</l>

					<l>what induc&apos;d People to run after him, my Mother invited him to</l>
					<l>Preach at our House but he did not chuse to do it except we</l>
					<l>would have a Society settled, to which she consented. In the mean</l>
					<l>time my Mother spoke very closely to me about the state of my</l>
					<l>Soul; thus prepar&apos;d I went to hear him again, During his Sermon</l>
					<l>I was made sensible of my last condition, I wish&apos;d I could alter,</l>
					<l>and thought I had better be depreved, of this Worlds pleasure then</l>
					<l>love my mortal Soul, I thought I could part with every thing</l>
					<l>I had in the World to be assur&apos;d of my Salvation; but fear&apos;d it</l>
					<l>was impossible. In this miserable state I continued a long time</l>
					<l>and came into self working. by degrees my misery worse off and</l>
					<l>I concluded this was the right way to do all the good that was in my</l>
					<l>power, so my conscience was to be appeased, but being of a hasty</l>
					<l>temper and sometimes overcome with passion, my good oppinion</l>
					<l>of my self vanish&apos;d and I became miserable again. In the Year</l>
					<l>1740. M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Ingham and B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Teltshig came to our house, the latter</l>
					<l>could not speak English, but his look made a particular impression</l>
					<l>on me and I believed him to be indeed  a Child of God. In a short time</l>
					<l>after this Visit out Society was dispers&apos;d which troubled me very</l>
					<l>much. One of them and myself desir&apos;d to be admitted into another Society</l>
					<l>wich was soon after the case with a small company at Holbeck near</l>
					<l>Leeds; But not having the pleasure to see B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> often, I grew dry</l>
					<l>in my heart, Upon being ask&apos;d to be Servant in a Family, I at first</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>refused but being earnestly intreated I at last accepted and went to</l>
					<l>the place. I was very uneasy in it for I found. I had no freedom</l>
					<l>to mix in worldly company, but was Oblidged to stay my time</l>
					<l>out. The night before I left my place, I drew that Verse, When</l>
					<l>I was lost and far had stray&apos;d. Into a Desart wild &amp; the day</l>
					<l>after when I was with my Mother some Sisters came to see me, I</l>
					<l>told them what had pass&apos;d, they advised me to make a new begining</l>
					<l>and then our Saviour and the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> would forgive me these words</l>
					<l>comforted me for I did not expect to hear such from them. The first</l>
					<l>meeting I went to after their Visit, B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Telstig kept on the following</l>
					<l>words&quot; ye cannot serve two Masters &quot;it seem&apos;d as if he directed</l>
					<l>his discourse to me alone and I determin&apos;d to have our Saviour</l>
					<l>alone for my Master. a short time after I was advised to live with</l>
					<l>two Sisters in Holbeck, I did so, but my sittuation was not at first</l>
					<l>agreable to me, I did not remain long with them being desir&apos;d by</l>
					<l>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Tiltsheg to go to Leeds to wait on a Sick Sister, but soon became</l>
					<l>sick myself, as I had then no money left to help me I was persuaded to </l>
					<l>live with my Mother with whom I remain&apos;d till she died. The day</l>
					<l>before she departed a Sister visited her where she would like to have</l>
					<l>me sittuated; she reply&apos;d, among the Sisters, But after her death I</l>
					<l>felt such a strong attachment to my Relations that I thought I could</l>
					<l>not part with them, which brought me again into trouble and quite</l>
					<l>at a loss what to do, When I was by my self my faithful Monitor</l>
					<l>convinc&apos;d me once more that I was not in my right place; to stay then</l>
					<l>would be dangerous for my Soul. I immediately set off to acquaint</l>

					<l>my former Laboress and disclos&apos;d my whole case, She recomended</l>
					<l>me to another Family in Holbeck, this was in the Year 1750</l>
					<l>I attended the Preaching in Fulneck every Sunday. B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> LaTrobe</l>
					<l>Sermons were a real blessing<hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>s</hi> to me and I frequently imagin&apos;d</l>
					<l>that he knew my inmost thoughts, I had no rest day nor night</l>
					<l>on account of the burden of my sins, One day as I was by myself</l>
					<l>earnestly entreating our Saviour to manifest himself unto me,</l>
					<l>he granted, my request and gave me a full assurance of the for</l>
					<l>giveness of my sins, which came with such power that it melted</l>
					<l>me into tears. from this time and particularly during my stay</l>
					<l>in that Family, I received many blessings from our Savior, This</l>
					<l>was a particular period with the Brethrens Congregation, their</l>
					<l>enemies in these parts where not affraid to prognasticate their</l>
					<l>ruin notwithstanding this I wish&apos;d for a still closer union with</l>
					<l>them and importun&apos;d to be a member of the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> The two S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>with whom I Liv&apos;d having departed this Life it was thought proper</l>
					<l>for me to leave Holbeck and I was placed at last to my great joy</l>
					<l>in the Single S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Oeconomy at Gomersal May 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1755, and was</l>
					<l>soon at home with them, tho, it prov&apos;d a new school for my heart.</l>
					<l>The 3<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> of March 1756 I was inform&apos;d would be a general Congregation </l>
					<l>Day. I got an impression on that day I should have the favor to</l>
					<l>be added thereto, I therfore kept a band with our Savior sensible of</l>
					<l>my poverty and helplessness yet comforted with his nearness.</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>In this Sittuation of mind according to my impression I was</l>
					<l>received into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> on the above mentioned day which</l>
					<l>prov&apos;d a great blessing to me Thus far her own account</l>
					<l>April 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1756 our late Sister remov&apos;d from Gommersal to live</l>
					<l>in the Choir House here. March 21<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> 1757 she partook of the </l>
					<l>holy Communion with the Congregation for the first time, It</l>
					<l>was evident notwithstanding all human imperfection that she</l>
					<l>had found her peace with our Savior. She knew in whom she beleivd</l>
					<l>and was perswaded that he was able to keep that which she</l>
					<l>had comitted unto him this help&apos;d her through every trying</l>
					<l>circumstance she met with; her call to the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of Jesus she</l>
					<l>value&apos;d highly and often spoke of it with the greatest gratitude</l>
					<l>It was a particular pleasure to her to serve her Sisters in any little</l>
					<l>matters she was able to do which she did with great faithfulness</l>
					<l>as long as her strength would admitt of it. The begin<hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>g</hi>ning of</l>
					<l>this Year an Asmatick complaint which she had labor&apos;d</l>
					<l>under many years grew very troublesome to her, so that</l>
					<l>She was oblidg&apos;d in Jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> to move into the sick room, when</l>
					<l>her longing to be at home with our Savior increased daily. It</l>
					<l>gave her much pain when two of her companions in the Sick</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>

				<lg>
					<l>room were called home before her, she suffer&apos;d much in her sick,</l>
					<l>ness which made her sometimes rather impatient and think </l>
					<l>the time long, but she would soon recollect herself again and in</l>
					<l>treated our Savior to give her a Childlike resignation to his will</l>
					<l>that she might not greive him by her impatience. The night</l>
					<l>before her departure, she said I am waiting for our Saviour</l>
					<l>to come and fetch <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>her</hi> me, he will not be long now before he comes</l>
					<l>I shall then see him for my self; sickness and sorow will have</l>
					<l>an end, He will wipe all tears from my Eyes. that night she</l>
					<l>spent in great Weakness but in converse with her best Freind</l>
					<l>Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 10<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> the happy moment came when she departed in a soft</l>
					<l>and easy manner to her dear Redeemer with the blessing of</l>
					<l>her Choir half past 10 oclock in the forenoon during a sensible</l>
					<l>feeling of our dear Lords presence, in the 72<hi rend='superscript:true;'>nd</hi> Year of her Age.</l>
