					<l>died May / 45</l>
					<l>Our late S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Eliz<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Procter was born</l>
					<l>just outside the settlement Sept<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 10<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> / 19</l>
					<l>&amp; baptized on the 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> by B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Ramftler</l>
					<l>In Aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> / 26 her mother departed this life</l>
					<l>happily. On her deathbed she was much</l>
					<l>distressed at the tho<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> of leaving her hus</l>
					<l>band with 6 little children, but she fer</l>
					<l>vently commended him &amp; them to the Lord</l>
					<l>&amp; we have every reason to believe, that</l>
					<l>He graciously heard &amp; answered all her</l>
					<l>prayers for them; four of her children</l>
					<l>have now joined her happy spirit, we</l>
					<l>may confidently say, in the realms of</l>
					<l>bliss; &amp; the other 2 are, we trust, &amp; be</l>
					<l>lieve, earnestly desirous to follow them. </l>
					<l>In her childhood our late S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> attended</l>
					<l>the Day School for Girls held in our</l>
					<l>Sisters House <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>&amp; was early</hi>. The</l>
					<l>H. Spirit early commenced a work of </l>
					<l>grace in her soul, impressing her with</l>
					<l>a sense of her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> love, &amp; a desire to</l>
					<l>live to him; this manifested itself</l>
					<l>in a hatred of all evil, &amp; those that good</l>
					<l>fruits of the spirit which are produ</l>
					<l>ced even in childhood. She was always</l>
					<l>of a very amiable disposition, &amp; beloved</l>
					<l>by her superiours &amp; equals, by old &amp; young. </l>
					<l>She has for several years kept her fa</l>
					<l>thers house in which that capacity shewn</l>
					<l>great prudence &amp; management, &amp; in</l>
					<l>deed in all respects been a most af</l>
					<l>fectionate, dutiful &amp; valuable daugh</l>
					<l>ter. She was confirmed &amp; admitted</l>
					<l>to the holy Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in Dec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. 1837, being</l>
					<l>desirous to enjoy all the means of</l>

				<lg>
					<l>church, &amp; to make a public profession</l>
					<l>of her faith &amp; her love to the our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>.; &amp; we</l>
					<l>rejoice to hear her be able to magnify the grace of</l>
					<l>God that was given in her by saying that</l>
					<l>she walked worthy of her high calling &amp;</l>
					<l>??? by her meek &amp; quiet spirit,</l>
					<l>her spiritual frame, &amp; her blameless </l>
					<l>conduct, that she walked humbly with</l>
					<l>her God &amp; clave to Jesus with purpose</l>
					<l>of heart. In May / 41 her elder</l>
					<l>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. Agnes departed this life of con</l>
					<l>sumption at the age of ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 24; in April</l>
					<l>/ 43 her brother Joseph, aged 19, followed</l>
					<l>her into eternity, &amp; in May last year</l>
					<l>George, and 22 1/2, all dying of the same</l>
					<l>disease, &amp; all falling asleep in Jesus;</l>
					<l>the latter indeed was a brand snatched</l>
					<l>from the burning, yet he was we believe,</l>
					<l>a true penitent &amp; died a pardoned &amp;</l>
					<l>regenerate believer: his late sisters</l>
					<l>conversation &amp; evangelical counsel especially during his last illness was</l>
					<l>probably none of the least officious</l>
					<l>means employed by our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>. for bring</l>
					<l>ing ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> this blessed change in him. </l>
					<l>Elizabeth nursed all these patients</l>
					<l>throughout their lingering &amp; at</l>
					<l>last painful illness complaint with exemplary</l>
					<l>tenderness &amp; patience; to make them</l>
					<l>as comfortable as possible, &amp; to direct</l>
					<l>their thoughts to spiritual things seem</l>
					<l>to be her study &amp; delight; nor did she </l>
					<l>ever appear to think highly of herself for</l>
					<l>her exemplary conduct in this respect;</l>
					<l>far less was she ever heard to murmur</l>
					<l>&amp; complain. When her brother George</l>
				</lg>

			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>died last May, she was already very</l>
					<l>unwell consumptions of the same com</l>
					<l>plaint that her bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> had; &amp; br<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> to an</l>
					<l>early grave developed themselves in her</l>
					<l>more &amp; more; she was well aware of</l>
					<l>this herself &amp; said more than once that</l>
					<l>she believed she should follow them at</l>
					<l>no great distance of time. In the</l>
					<l>course of the late severe winter she</l>
					<l>grew rapidly worse, &amp; it was soon evi</l>
					<l>dent that her days were numbered, &amp;</l>
					<l>that the spring of the present year would</l>
					<l>probably put an end to her sufferings &amp; her</l>
					<l>earthly existence. She continued how</l>
					<l>ever to come downstairs as long as she</l>
					<l>possibly could, &amp; was not many weeks</l>
					<l>confined to her sick chamber. Until </l>
					<l>the disease had nearly consumed her</l>
					<l>lungs &amp; her strength was well nigh</l>
					<l>spent, she did not suffer much pain,</l>
					<l>her principal ailment being increasing</l>
					<l>weakness; but when the pulmonary or</l>
					<l>gans were nearly destroyed, &amp; her</l>
					<l>bodily powers all but exhausted, she</l>
					<l>suffered greatly, chiefly from diffi</l>
					<l>culty of breathing &amp; a sense of suffe</l>
					<l>cations; this increased most distressingly</l>
					<l>on Monday last ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 2 o&apos;clock p.m. &amp; continued </l>
					<l>for 7 or 8 hours; at length, however, the</l>
					<l>disease seemed to have exhausted its</l>
					<l>power virulance, &amp; she lay quiet &amp; apparently</l>
					<l>easy till 1/2 past 12 o&apos;clock on Monday </l>
					<l>morning when the happy moment came </l>
					<l>that delivered her from all pain from</l>
					<l>sin &amp; sorrow, her spirit ascending to</l>
					<l>Him who needs &amp; redeemed her.</l>

					<l>The writer of this brief memoir</l>
					<l>can truly say that he never witnessed a</l>
					<l>more satisfactory, peaceful &amp; happy</l>
					<l>sick &amp; deathbed than that of our late S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>She manifested that truly meek &amp; quiet spirit</l>
					<l>which is in the sight of God of great price;</l>
					<l>a deep humility, arising from a sense of</l>
					<l>her own sinfulness, yet at the same time</l>
					<l>an habitually peaceful &amp; even cheerful</l>
					<l>frame, so that even when her sufferings </l>
					<l>bef above described were at the highest, the</l>
					<l>smile that constantly lit up her counte</l>
					<l>nance was still beaming there; not a </l>
					<l>word of murmuring ever escaped her</l>
					<l>lips; on the other hand, she spoke conti</l>
					<l>ually with deep gratitude of the</l>
					<l>many &amp; various mercies she enjoyed, &amp; </l>
					<l>of her being spared acute pain, saying:</l>
					<l>&quot;O how graciously I am carried and</l>
					<l>what cause have I for thankfulness!</l>
					<l>She was most grateful to all who shewed</l>
					<l>her any attention, &amp; especially for spiri</l>
					<l>tual conversation which for spiritual </l>
					<l>&amp; heavenly things being now her element</l>
					<l>&amp; her chief joy; she was delighted when thanks</l>
					<l>giving &amp; prayer were offered up by her</l>
					<l>bedside. Twice, during her illness, the</l>
					<l>holy Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> was administered to her in</l>
					<l>the presence of a few friends; &amp; both times</l>
					<l>she was quite overcome with feelings of</l>
					<l>peace, love &amp; joy in the sense of her Savr&apos;s</l>
					<l>dying love &amp; of His pardon &amp; nearness.</l>
					<l>Indeed, it may truly be said say &amp; the</l>
					<l>circumstances the more remarkable,</l>
					<l>as it is somewhat uncommon even in</l>
					<l>the case of the most established &amp; experi-</l>
					<l>enced - that he never once, or any</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>occasion, even when her sufferings were</l>
					<l>most severe, heard a word of complaint</l>
					<l>from her lips saw even a transient</l>
					<l>cloud obscure darken her mind, which was con</l>
					<l>stantly serene &amp; cheered by the light</l>
					<l>of her Redeemer&apos;s countenance. X She</l>
					<l>was most affectionate to all around</l>
					<l>her &amp; spoke in a very instructive &amp;</l>
					<l>encouraging strain to her young friends</l>
					<l>&amp; relatives of the things that make</l>
					<l>for peace, begging them to continue ear</l>
					<l>nestly to seek that one thing ??? soul</l>
					<l>everlasting portion which now made</l>
					<l>her so blessed, tho&apos; hastening to the</l>
					<l>grave in the bloom of youth. And</l>
					<l>whence all these striking &amp; lovely fruits</l>
					<l>of righteousness, so richly nurtured in</l>
					<l>her? Whence but from her such simple child</l>
					<l>like, unwavering faith in Jesus, her</l>
					<l>placing all her trust in him, looking </l>
					<l>to him &amp; him alone, &amp; keeping good</l>
					<l>hold of him as her all; in a word, &quot;holding</l>
					<l>the beginning of her confidence fast unto</l>
					<l>the end.&quot; Often did she declare, that</l>
					<l>she had no hope but in her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, but</l>
					<l>that she knew that he was her&apos;s &amp; she</l>
					<l>His; &amp; that she had now no other desire but</l>
					<l>to go to him, knowing assuradly, that</l>
					<l>he would receive her. On Sunday abt</l>
					<l>between 1 &amp; 2 o&apos;clock she rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> the blessing </l>
					<l>for her departure during a sweet sense</l>
					<l>of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> presence &amp; peace. On</l>
					<l>Monday evening as our Sunday scholars</l>
					<l>were perambulating the place with mu</l>
					<l>sic &amp; singing, it was suggested that a verse </l>
					<l>or two should be sung under her window. </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Accordingly the 1<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi> &amp; 6<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Verses of N<hi rend='superscript:true;'>o</hi></l>
					<l>were sung &amp; played there, viz. The Savr&apos;s</l>
					<l>blood &amp;c. &amp; And when my Sav I shall see &amp;c.</l>
					<l>She afterwards said to a friend who called</l>
					<l>to her say that she had heard &amp; understood</l>
					<l>the verses, &amp; enjoyed it greatly. She</l>
					<l>lived about 5 hours after this, was sensible</l>
					<l>to the last, &amp; expired wihtout a sigh or a</l>
					<l>groan age 25 1/2 years, receiving the end </l>
					<l>of her faith, even the salvation of her</l>
					<l>soul.</l>
					<l>X When she first saw that her recovery</l>
					<l>was impossible, she felt much, indeed,</l>
					<l>at the tho<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> of leaving her father, as </l>
					<l>she knew what a severe trial her loss</l>
					<l>would be to him; but it is doubt</l>
					<l>&amp; fears of a spiritual nature that</l>
					<l>are here alluded to, &amp; praise which</l>
					<l>she was most mercifully preserved.</l>
