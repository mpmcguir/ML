					<l>Mary Athill died July / 46</l>
					<l>Born with twin S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Sarah in Antigua 18</l>
					<l>July 9 / 14. came to Brit<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in 1821 first </l>
					<l>to Edinbro&apos;, then to Fuln. Sch with elder</l>
					<l>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Esther; remained here till Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> / 28, when </l>
					<l>went first to London, where confirm<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in </l>
					<l>ch of Engl<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in 1829 went back to Antigua</l>
					<l>where rem<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> till / 36; after residence of</l>
					<l>5 yrs in Lond came to live in S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> house</l>
					<l>here in / 41. Admitted com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> members</l>
					<l>in summer / 43.</l>
					<l>In the course of last year certain circum</l>
					<l>stances occurred, which convinced our late</l>
					<l>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi>, in a painful manner, but most affec</l>
					<l>tually of the emptiness &amp; deceitfulness of</l>
					<l>this world; &amp; shewed her that, however se re</l>
					<l>cluded mote from worldly vanity &amp; pleasure</l>
					<l>our settlements may be, they are at the</l>
					<l>same time screened from much evil,</l>
					<l>&amp; unvisited by many &amp; placing</l>
					<l>my bitter &amp; heart rending cares &amp; sor</l>
					<l>rows; &amp; that true place &amp; lasting en</l>
					<l>joyment are to be found only in the</l>
					<l>ways of genuine piety; in a word, that</l>
					<l>&quot;godliness with contentment&quot; is great</l>
					<l>gain. The consequence was that,</l>
					<l>after on returning, after an absence of</l>
					<l>about 8 mo<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s.</hi> to our S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs&apos; </hi>house &amp; to the</l>
					<l>church of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>. she evidently lived</l>
					<l>in much more comfort than before,</l>
					<l>set a higher value on her privileges,</l>
					<l>temporal &amp; spiritual, seemed to enjoy</l>
					<l>the means of grace, &amp; grew, we trust</l>
					<l>in the inner way, in knowledge &amp; </l>
					<l>in grace.</l>
					<l>Her health was always delicate, &amp; in</l>
					<l>the course of last Winter, began to fail</l>
					<l>more &amp; more, so that, in spring, fears began</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to be entertained of the result. In</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>May</hi> June last month she went to Burlington to try the</l>
					<l>effect of the sea-air; but all was in vain, &amp;</l>
					<l>she returned in abt. a fortnight <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>for</hi></l>
					<l>weaker than when she left us. About a week After</l>
					<l>her arrival here, however, she seemed to</l>
					<l>rally very much so that we began to che</l>
					<l>rish hopes of her eventual recovery; but she</l>
					<l>soon sank again, &amp; very rapidly; &amp; a</l>
					<l>physician being called in, at once de</l>
					<l>clared that there was not a shadow of</l>
					<l>hope. It fell to my lot to inform our</l>
					<l>late sister of this, which I did in as gentle</l>
					<l>a manner as I could devise. From the</l>
					<l>commencement of her illness, she had</l>
					<l>expressed a very great anxiety to recover;</l>
					<l>&amp; tho&apos; she seemed aware how well</l>
					<l>founded were the many hints were her</l>
					<l>of the danger of her case, &amp; of the necessity</l>
					<l>of preparing to meet her God, &amp; that she </l>
					<l>certainly did not neglect the one thing</l>
					<l>needful, yet she flattered herself with </l>
					<l>hopes of recovery getting better &amp; clung to life, until </l>
					<l>the interview I had with her above allu</l>
					<l>ded to &amp; which took place in the evening</l>
					<l>of 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi>, the day before her birthday. She</l>
					<l>certainly seemed both alarmed &amp; distressed</l>
					<l>when she at length learned there was no</l>
					<l>hope; but she listened most eagerly, &amp; I</l>
					<l>believe, with childlike faith, to my ear</l>
					<l>nest adminitions, to turn to Jesus, the </l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> from sin &amp; deathl &amp; also to the encou</l>
					<l>ragements I endeavoured to give her, by </l>
					<l>pourtraying in scripture-phrase, the</l>
					<l>infinite compassion &amp; tender mercy</l>
					<l>of that Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi>, his readiness to pardon</l>
					<l>&amp; receive every one that believeth. X</l>
					<l>Before this period she had often been hard</l>
					<l>X as well as to the fervent I offered up by her side</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>praying very fervently in the night. ???</l>
					<l>for acceptance in the Beloved for pardon,</l>
					<l>peace, santification &amp; redepemtion. </l>
					<l>From the day just now mentioned,</l>
					<l>July 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> I found her, at each subse</l>
					<l>quent visit, more &amp; more composed,</l>
					<l>her light &amp; peace of mind continually</l>
					<l>increasing; she was evidently delighted</l>
					<l>to hear of Jesus, &amp; to listen to the prayers</l>
					<l>offered up on her behalf &amp; was, no doubt,</l>
					<l>very grateful to her choir-labourer &amp; </l>
					<l>other friends for all spiritual advice &amp; en</l>
					<l>couragement given her as well as for other proofs</l>
					<l>of kindness &amp; various attentions.</l>
					<l>I saw her last on Saturday 18<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> visit</l>
					<l>about noon; she then told me, that she</l>
					<l>felt quite happy &amp; had no fear of death</l>
					<l>because she was persuaded that, tho&apos; she</l>
					<l>knew herself to be a poor miserable</l>
					<l>sinner, her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> had pardoned her blotted</l>
					<l>out all her sins, &amp; would receive her</l>
					<l>in mercy to himself. In this peace</l>
					<l>ful frame she continued until 5</l>
					<l>o&apos;clock on Sunday morning, when after </l>
					<l>having suffered some violent convul</l>
					<l>sions, she fell asleep in Jesus, aged</l>
					<l>32 years.</l>
					<l>Our last Sister&apos;s conduct was gene</l>
					<l>rally speaking regular, strictly moral,</l>
					<l>&amp; marked generally speaking, by</l>
					<l>uprightness &amp; conscientiousness.</l>
					<l>Yet we will not deny that there were</l>
					<l>not many decided manifestations in</l>
					<l>her character, of spiritual life, until</l>
					<l>her last illness. the good Providence</l>
					<l>of God led her last year thro&apos; heavy trials, which</l>
					<l>ever bless for her instruction in</l>
					<l>righteousness, &amp; prepared her we believe,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>for those life-giving operations of His</l>
					<l>spirit, which finally issued contract</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>&amp; believe</hi> in <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>her</hi> full salvation, &amp; in her</l>
					<l>being needs meet for the inheritance</l>
					<l>of the saints in light. May the</l>
					<l>Lord be the consolation &amp; support of</l>
					<l>her surviving twin sister &amp; give her</l>
					<l>both her &amp; all our young members</l>
					<l>yea of all us grace. to give diligence</l>
					<l>to make our calling &amp; election sure, </l>
					<l>&amp; to work while it is called to day</l>
					<l>seeing the night cometh, in which no</l>
					<l>man can work. </l>
