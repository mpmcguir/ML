					<l>Esther Preston, who went to our Savr on Febry the 22 1771</l>
					<l>was born at Kirkheaton Ap 8 1719, of Ch Engl Parrents</l>
					<l>She has left the following Concerning her Course, I have</l>
					<l>from my earliest years, felt the drawings of the holy spirits</l>
					<l>upon my heart, tho I did not understand it at that time.</l>
					<l>When about 4 years old I asked my Parrents to take me with</l>
					<l>them to Church, which they promised me Soon, having asked my</l>
					<l>mother what the Church was, She told me it was Gods House,</l>
					<l>which made me verry desirous of being there, in somuch that</l>
					<l>my Parrents being from home, I desir &apos;d to be carry&apos; d in a</l>
					<l>Coffin &amp; bury&apos; d before they came back upon their return they</l>
					<l>took me with them, when there, the impression of the divine</l>
					<l>Presence of God struck my mind, so as I never had felt the like</l>
					<l>and remain&apos;d with me so that when among my school Companions </l>
					<l>if any one told a lie or said any Bad thing, it made me much</l>
					<l>afraid thinking and often saying if we was good Children then</l>
					<l>God would love us, but if not so, we shou&apos;d go to hell, about</l>
					<l>9 years of age I was taken ill of a fever, which I had hardly</l>
					<l>recover &apos;d before the same return&apos;d, during which time I was verry</l>
					<l>uneasy, feeling my own depravity, and not knowing how to </l>
					<l>amend my self upon my recovery, I learn&apos;d to read the Bible </l>
					<l>especially the new Testament Concerning Our Savrs death &amp; Suffferings</l>
					<l>tho I did not understand, that He Suffer&apos;d for me, but</l>
					<l>thought by reading, Praying &amp; doing nothing bad, I should</l>
					<l>obtain the favour &amp; love of God, yet this afforded me no real</l>
					<l>Satisfaction, I thought if my Companions where but of one mind</l>
					<l>with me then we could Serve the Lord, but they were not of</l>
					<l>my mind, I often thought if there was but a people in this world,</l>
					<l>of one heart to Serve the Lord, and if I might but live among</l>
					<l>them I should then be happy, but not having the Opportunity</l>
					<l>of such Aquaintance at that time my former Companions soon</l>
					<l>Soon overcame me &amp; in my 15 year took me to the dancing school</l>
					<l>with them, which together with my inclination led me aside from</l>
					<l>my former Convictions, so that I now lik&apos;d nothing better than</l>
					<l>singing &amp; dancing, this did not last very long, when by accident</l>
					<l>I not a Funeral Sermon, upon the death of a young Person, the</l>
					<l>Text was Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth,</l>
					<l>This brought me again to recolect my self, I thought if I go</l>
					<l>on in this way I shall surely be lost, whereupon I began to leave</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>leave it of as much as I could, but my Companions being very</l>
					<l>dear to me made it verry difficult to me, on the other had</l>
					<l>accidental Circumstances brought me to a further thought</l>
					<l>Concerning my self as I narrowly escaped being drowned 3 times</l>
					<l>but was providentially preserved, after which time I could no</l>
					<l>longer in any of my former amusements or Company, find any</l>
					<l>Pleasure or Satisfaction, but was Continualy uneasy in my mind</l>
					<l>Thus far our late Sister, When Mr Ingham began to preach in</l>
					<l>the Churches, she went to hear him and by his means got aquainted</l>
					<l>with the Br when she found to her Great Joy the people she</l>
					<l>had so long wish&apos;d for, She soon got admission into their</l>
					<l>fellowship, was rec&apos;d into the Congn July 26 1744 &amp; admitted to the </l>
					<l>Holy Communion on her desire  to live with the Sisters, caus&apos;d</l>
					<l>her to leave her Fathers House soon after, &amp; she lived for some</l>
					<l>time with a few Sisters at Robert town from whence she removd</l>
					<l>to Cleckheaton Oeconony 1746, where she went on in her usual</l>
					<l>Simple Course; till she with some others mov&apos;d to the House</l>
					<l>Oeconomy where she remain&apos;d till the Childrs Oeconomy came down</l>
					<l>to smith house when she and more Sisters went to Care for the </l>
					<l>Child&apos;rn&apos;s  wash she was much belov&apos;d, for her Simple.</l>
					<l>faithful attachment to Our Savr &amp; his Congn. The of 15 1752 </l>
					<l>She had the Grace to be one of the first inhabitants of the</l>
					<l>Choir house at fullneck. She had also the grace to be</l>
					<l>present at the Choir Communion, kept by the late Disciple in</l>
					<l>1754, when the Discipleship was renew &apos;d in the Congn she</l>
					<l>injoyd that grace several times as Choir Discipless amidst all</l>
					<l>those favours she knew herself as the poorest Creature,</l>
					<l>and had a sup impression of what our Saviour has done for</l>
					<l>her, &amp; thro the deep Sence of undeserved Grace, she cou&apos;d not</l>
					<l>hear an unintire thought but made it known to her Sisters </l>
					<l>with bitter Complaints that our Savr had not got the better</l>
					<l>of such &amp; such things for which he had suffer&apos;d so much,</l>
					<l>Nor cou&apos;d ever rest till he had Comforted her over every</l>
					<l>deviation from Him by which means, she improv&apos;d daily,</l>
					<l>in the sinnerlike Connection with Our Savr and the Sisters</l>
					<l>and was a real Blessing to all about her, and to whom</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>She was known, She was on example of True Love and</l>
					<l>Simplicity, She spoke as familiarly with our Savr, as if</l>
					<l>He was her Bosom friend, about all her matters inwardly</l>
					<l>and outwardly, and took her daily strength from His dear</l>
					<l>Boson Her Memory, will Remain dear to her Choir.</l>
					<l>as the Beauty of a happy Sinneres was seen, and felt</l>
					<l>in her On account of her great weakness she has for</l>
					<l>Several months Past been in the Sickroom where she was</l>
					<l>as exeeding agreable Companion to the Sick and as much</l>
					<l>as her strength would permit waited on them with great</l>
					<l>pleasure, On the 15 of Febry she got up in the Morning</l>
					<l>as usual But soon after was heard to groan, when the</l>
					<l>Sisters came to her she was hoppling against the wall, being</l>
					<l>struck with a fitt on her right side &amp; Speechless, for</l>
					<l>some days we was in hopes she woud Recover, and be</l>
					<l>enabled to speak again, but found all means us&apos;d to</l>
					<l>no purpose, Our Gracious Lord had already rejoin&apos;d</l>
					<l>this Flower and made her in her last days, partaker</l>
					<l>of His Sufferings. She Continued mostly unsencible, Till</l>
					<l>on the 25 at 9 o Clock on the evening when her precious</l>
					<l>Soul took flight into the arms of her Beloved just</l>
					<l>as the horns where blowing, for the Sacrament Lovefeast</l>
