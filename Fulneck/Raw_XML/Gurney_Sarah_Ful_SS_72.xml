					<l>Sarah Gurney.</l>
					<l>I was Born in Mimms Middlesex, Octr the 27th 1745.  My Parents <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>was</hi> were of the</l>
					<l>Church of England wherein I was Baptiz&apos;d &amp; brought up. In my Childhood</l>
					<l>I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must</l>
					<l>attain to something at yet unpossess&apos;d, or I could not be saved.  My natural diss-</l>
					<l>position was flighty so that what tender impressions I had in my heart, <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>was</hi> were</l>
					<l>of short duration. When I was 13 years old a Discenting Gentlewoman took</l>
					<l>me into her family, where I was instructed in <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>those</hi> the principles of that denomination; I read their</l>
					<l>Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which frighten&apos;d</l>
					<l>me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour&apos;d</l>
					<l>to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading,</l>
					<l>praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer&apos;d before those of the</l>
					<l>E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In 1730 my</l>
					<l>Father being sick I visited him &amp; was greatly concerned for his Salvation,</l>
					<l>&amp; therefore kneel&apos;d down by his bed, read &amp; pray&apos;d by him, putting the Bible</l>
					<l>into his Hands, when he open&apos;d to that portion of Scripture, Remember</l>
					<l>thy Creator in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may</l>
					<l>not be hid from thine Eyes. This so Affected me that I immediately rose up,</l>
					<l>giving up all the concern I had for my dear Fathers happiness, trusting to</l>
					<l>this Lord for his Salvation, taking those words as a demand from God upon</l>
					<l>me; nevertheless the loss of so affectionate a Parent affected me so, that I</l>
					<l>wish&apos;d to be buried with him, believing I shou&apos;d never care for life any more.</l>
					<l>In 1733 my Lady also departed &amp; I return&apos;d to London, where I waited on 2</l>
					<l>young Ladies, who with their Mother Lady Askew <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>was</hi> were of the E. Church</l>
					<l>but lived in all the gayeties of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions,</l>
					<l>I went into all manner of those so called innocent diversions viz Cards,</l>
					<l>Dancing, plays &amp; yet not without strong convictions which at times caused</l>
					<l>me very heavy reflections. In this family I was in the way of many &amp; great</l>
					<l>temptations, so that at length I was obliged to leave my place, &amp; got another</l>
					<l>in Putney, where all my convictions return&apos;d, &amp; a deep sense of my miserable</l>
					<l>condition caused a melancholy to overwhelm me, which notwithstanding the</l>
					<l>advise &amp; admonitions of Ministers &amp; who endeavor&apos;d to persuade me that I</l>
					<l>enough yet I was convinced of the contrary &amp; wanted to find out a</l>
					<l>of God, for I firmly believed there were such in the world &amp; that they</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>could help me. The housekeeper in the family being a relation of the late</l>
					<l>Br Williams, <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>she</hi> invited him one day to Tea, which gave me an oppertunity</l>
					<l>(when she went out) to ask him what religion he was of? He told me the Church</l>
					<l>of England; I being concern&apos;d &amp; he appearing the same to me, I took the freedom</l>
					<l>to ask him of he always went to the Church, he ans&apos;d not always; I desir&apos;d</l>
					<l>to know where then; he told me there was a religious Society in Fetter Lane.</l>
					<l>I ask&apos;d him if I might have leave to come? he said yes, as also told me the</l>
					<l>time of they meetings &amp; promis&apos;d (it being winter) to come for me, which he</l>
					<l>faithfully did the next Sunday at 5 in the morning. Here I heard Br Brown</l>
					<l>preach from the Text He was wounded for our transgressions, he was</l>
					<l>bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, &amp; with</l>
					<l>his stripes we are healed. We had not set long before the people from</l>
					<l>without peltered us with stores &amp; bricks breaking the windows &amp; doing much</l>
					<l>mischief, so that I was very much frightened &amp; not able to attend to the Sermon.</l>
					<l>The late Sr Loyd by whom I sat bad me be compos&apos;d, for she had that</l>
					<l>confidence in the Lord that he would not suffer us to be hurt, &amp; when the</l>
					<l>preaching was over ask&apos;d me how I had lik&apos;d it? I ansd I could not tell,</l>
					<l>for altho&apos; I was very desirous to to sav&apos;d, yet I believed I shou&apos;d never come any</l>
					<l>more there, for I was terribly frighten&apos;d, &amp; thought that thereby I risk&apos;d my</l>
					<l>life, consequently I went no more for 3 years, during which time I was wishing</l>
					<l>much to get into a Nunery, &amp; did all in my power to attain to the same, but</l>
					<l>as I was informed that I must go to France, for which I had not ability</l>
					<l>otherwise then as a servant, which I did not chuse, as I was informed they</l>
					<l>would use me as their slave, I dropt that scheme; At this time there was to be a confirmation</l>
					<l>in the Church, when I consequently with many other young women was</l>
					<l>confirm&apos;d by the Bishop, &amp; the Sunday following partook of the Lord&apos;s</l>
					<l>Supper during which I felt the Lord blessed me. After all this I got</l>
					<l>an inclination to go again to Fetter Lane &amp; found there was a Congn settled</l>
					<l>&amp; all stillness, where I again met with Br Willams &amp; Sr Loyd whom I knew,</l>
					<l>I was directly assured in my heart that they were Childn of God, &amp; that to</l>
					<l>them I belonged. I was priviledged with going to all the meetings on that</l>
					<l>day, whereby I was more devinely assur&apos;d of my heavenly calling. The</l>
					<l>following week Br Williams sent me a note to come the next Sunday, </l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>when I should see some pilgrim Brs &amp; Srs, I did not understand</l>
					<l>his meaning, yet when I was present at a meeting, held to the S. Women</l>
					<l>by the late <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Disciple</hi> ordinary of the Brn in German which Br Spaningburg interpreted</l>
					<l>&amp; at which was present Anna Nitchman, Benigna &amp; Sr. Anna LaTrobe</l>
					<l>I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see.</l>
					<l>My coming to the Brn was kept secret from the family for 3/4 of a</l>
					<l>year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious</l>
					<l>sect of people, which bore an indifferent character, &amp; they fearing the</l>
					<l>consequence sent for the Minister which had me confirm&apos;d, he questioned</l>
					<l>me very strictly about the Brn, &amp; ask&apos;d me whether I realy knew that I</l>
					<l>was going among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken</l>
					<l>for I was convinc&apos;d they were Childn of God; he said how had I come</l>
					<l>to this knowledge? I told him I had felt it in my heart, that there was</l>
					<l>no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro&apos; faith in our Saviour</l>
					<l>to the forgiveness of sins; upon which he wish&apos;d me to say what sins</l>
					<l>I had committed, I ansd him I felt myself full of sin, altho&apos; I had been</l>
					<l>preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have forgiveness</l>
					<l>otherwise I cou&apos;d not saved. He ask&apos;d me many more questions, so that</l>
					<l>at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch&apos;d him all the Books that</l>
					<l>I had then in my possession of the Brns &amp; desir&apos;d him to read them</l>
					<l>atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time</l>
					<l>but in a few days he sent for me to his House return&apos;d me the Books and</l>
					<l>saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the</l>
					<l>Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp;</l>
					<l>wish&apos;d he knew them as well. After this conversation he came to our</l>
					<l>House &amp; desir&apos;d my Mrs to part with me, I being a very dangerous</l>
					<l>person &amp; enough to infect her whole House. I felt an exceeding great</l>
					<l>love for the Brns people &amp; wish&apos;d more earnestly for a nearer connection</l>
					<l>&amp; beg&apos;d our Saviour to make known his love in my heart, &amp; from this</l>
					<l>time was convinced had no righteousness, therefore ceased not to pray</l>
					<l>our Saviour for forgiveness &amp; that he wou&apos;d cloth me with his righte-</l>
					<l>ousness, which soon after I felt in my heart &amp; was as a new born child so</l>
					<l>free; it was as if our dear Saviour had shed his blood alone for me, I was</l>
					<l>quite happy &amp; every way well. This happiness tasted about 3 months,</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>but not knowing my own poverty &amp; weakness &amp; that I stood in need of</l>
					<l>renewed Grace every moment, I grew dark &amp; miserable &amp; reason&apos;d against our</l>
					<l>Saviour feeling an unwillingness to be stript of everything &amp; saved alone</l>
					<l>by him, I was often frightened at the sight of my self &amp; was wretched to</l>
					<l>the last degree: but the dear H. Ghost ceased not that work which he has</l>
					<l>begun in my heart but as I afterwards found all was unmerited grace &amp;</l>
					<l>favor. I took the Hymn Book up in my distress &amp; open&apos;d to that Verse ye</l>
					<l>wounds of Jesus bless me now &amp; blood of Jesus flow me thro&apos; &amp;c. &amp; I found again</l>
					<l>confidence to our Saviour. I came again to London &amp; was hirred in Mr Raymonds</l>
					<l>family. 1747 I was rec&apos;d into the Congn which was really blessed to me &amp;</l>
					<l>felt a longing desire to partake of the H. Sacrament, but a deep sense of my own</l>
					<l>unworthiness &amp; the feeling of my wretched nature made me afraid to venture</l>
					<l>on so sacred a matter, therefore waited 2 years longer, when I had a particular</l>
					<l>favorable opportunity with Anna Nitchman &amp;  A. Johanna in Red Lyon Square</l>
					<l>who advis&apos;d me to leave my place, which I readily did &amp; came to live with Sr</l>
					<l>Stonehouse, I was soon admitted to the H. Comn which made a lasting,</l>
					<l>impression on my heart for I knew &amp; felt I fed on the Lords body &amp; blood, but</l>
					<l>nevertheless I often hinder&apos;d myself of many blessings thro&apos; unfaithfullness</l>
					<l>which occasioned often hours of distress, but the dear H. Ghost often repre-</l>
					<l>sented to my heart the sufferings &amp; dying love of Jesus to procure my peace</l>
					<l>which made me truly ashamed &amp; a real humble sinner. After my Mrs decease I</l>
					<l>I was sent by our dear A. Nitchman to the Boys <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Oeconomy</hi> Nursery in Mile end</l>
					<l>where I enjoy&apos;d a very happy period &amp; sabatic season. 1754 I came to Sr Larish</l>
					<l>in Linsey House from whence in May 1755 we set out for Hhuth where we</l>
					<l>arrived July 12th here I was with my whole heart which made my time pass the</l>
					<l>better with my much respected Sr Larish. After her happy Departure I had</l>
					<l>the favor to go to the Choir house, where I have enjoy&apos;d many unspeakable</l>
					<l>blessings for my poor heart, particularly in the Choir meetings which the late Count</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Disciple</hi> kept in Bethelsdorf to which I went. In this Choir House at Hhuth I learnt</l>
					<l>to know myself better, which has prov&apos;d a wholesome school to me, &amp; for which I</l>
					<l>shall feel greatful to my latest breath. March 1758 I was admitted among</l>
					<l>the Intercessors which opportunities has prov&apos;d salutary &amp; blessed to me</l>
					<l>after which I liv&apos;d 4 years in the Childrns Oeconomy &amp; then rec&apos;d a call to Fulneck</l>
					<l>to be among the Childn there where, I also remain&apos;d 4 years, &amp; then came to live</l>
					<l>and the Choir House here where, I have been ever since thousand, thousand</l>
					<l>thanks be rendered to my gracious Lord &amp; Saviour who has led me thus far, &amp; assured</l>
					<l>me of my everlasting happiness in him.</l>

					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney</hi></l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>I have to add the following</hi>: Since I came into the single sisters house</l>
					<l>at Fulneck the Holy Ghost took me into his school, &amp; showed me that</l>
					<l>I ought to love our Saviour more than I did &amp; that I had not that earnest</l>
					<l>desire which I should have for the manifestation of his love to me. Though</l>
					<l>he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity</l>
					<l>poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular</l>
					<l>manner, I was in darkness sometimes through unbelief &amp; the feeling of my</l>
					<l>misery, &amp; if it one not for his love &amp; pitty he would have taken his grace from</l>
					<l>me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly</l>
					<l>that without him there is no happiness, I felt my lost estate but he drew me</l>
					<l>near to himself &amp; did not let me rest till I could by faith apply his Atone-</l>
					<l>ments to myself &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been</l>
					<l>more faithful to his leading I should have experienced more happiness &amp; have</l>
					<l>been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness</l>
					<l>&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but Jesus comforts me, who out</l>
					<l>mercy free me all my guilt with patience in the accursed tree. Now my</l>
					<l>hearts inclination is a deep prostration for my Saviours pain, To be therby</l>
					<l>melted so that each one felt it how I love that Man. May his love be</l>
					<l>be all my own &amp; may I in future love him with my whole heart </l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>from here to eternity</hi> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can</l>
					<l>never praise him sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child.</l>
					<l>His Holy Spirit often reproved me, but when with contrition I owned all to him, he</l>
					<l>forgave me again, In short I live by his forgiveness. He <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>I was</hi> cared for me</l>
					<l>with the tenderness of a Mother. O that I could praise my heavenly Father and my</l>
					<l>Saviour <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>&amp; I could</hi> better than I do! O that I did <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>might</hi>  never forget his mercies to me</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>which alas I have often done</hi> <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>by he</hi> and tho&apos; I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he my great Saviour still remained the same</l>
					<l>For which I <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>was</hi> I now will praise him as well as I can, &amp; <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>will</hi> shall do it better when I see him.</l>
