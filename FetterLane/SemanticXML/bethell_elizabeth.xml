					<p>1783. </p><p>Leominster Archives Course of Life of our late Maid Sister Eliz: Bethell from her own hand Writing.</p><p>I was born <date when="1754-05-21" cert="high">May the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1754</date> in the Town of <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monmouth" key="Monmouth" cert="high">Monmouth</placeName> where my Father was placed as Officer in the Excise, &amp; in my third Year my Father was removed to Leominster in Herefordshire; When I was about Six Years old, my Aunt took me to her into Shropshire; She had no Child of her own, &amp; was tender to me; My Unkle was of a rough disposition and subject to swear very much, which made me think God would not love him; for <del>if</del> I thought if I did once Swear I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> go to the bad Place, &amp; I often would go to the retir'd part of the Garden to pray to God to keep me from the place where bad Children were sent to. I was very fond of reading Books that mentiond anything about God; at last my Aunt began to be uneasy about me, &amp; thought I was not playfull enough like other Children: In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year my Mother came for me, &amp; took me home that I might have better Education; This was a hurt to me, &amp; I soon got a Love for pleasure, &amp; vain amusements &amp;quite forgot my religious Course; My Mother was exceding fond of me &amp; often would remind me what a reward was promised to those that love God; but the ever faithfull friend of Sinners knew how to make my pleasant days bitter, by taking from me my tender, &amp; Affectionate Mother in a few Months after I came home; this was a great trial to me, &amp; the holy <del>Ghost</del> <add place="above">Spirit</add> showed me how I had Sinned against God in getting out of the simple track I was in, in my youngerYears; I often called to mind how my dear Mother on her death Bed cryed out Dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> come &amp; take me; &amp; in a short time he took her to himself without Sigh or groan: I found I had now lost a good Friend, &amp; had it more difficult in many respects; This was a means of stirring up my thoughts to a religious Course, &amp; I was glad to get into any Corner I could to pray to God; &amp; I often wish'd to return again to my Aunt, &amp; carried a Book in my Pocket to be ready to go at any time; In a short time I became so distress'd about my Salvation that I would freely have given my body to have saved my Soul from the Misery w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I expected the Lord would lay upon me: I was now about 14 Years old; and my distress encreasing I once went into the Fields, &amp; wander'd about where there was no Path for </p>

				<p>any one to see me &amp; stay'd until it was dark: At another time the Enemy put such thoughts into my Head, as I saw no likelyhood of my finding happiness on Earth, I would therefore take the first Opportunity of putting an end to my Life; and I went one day by the Water Side to compleat my Wicked Intention; but the ever faithful Friend of Sinners still watched over me, &amp; prevented my wicked design: I returned home with Shame, &amp; true Repentance, begging of the Lord to put all such thoughts far from me, &amp; to look in Mercy on my afflicted Soul; A few Nights after I dreamed that I was in my Fathers Garden, &amp; was sighing &amp; bemoaning my distress of heart, &amp; I thought I heard a great Noise, &amp; looking up towards the Sky I thought I saw numbers of Angels coming towards me w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> lighted down by me, so that the Walk where I was was full; they were as I thought all dressed in white, &amp; I was the same, they had each of them two Wings w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I thought grew out of each Shoulder, but I thought I had none; After a short time spent in singing, &amp; a Sweet harmony of Musick, I thought all those happy Spirits went to a fine Pool of Water wch was in a Meadow, &amp; I went with them, &amp; I thought we all washed our Feet; And after that they all flew up, &amp; I was left alone: I then got more easy in my Mind, &amp; thought I might take it for granted that God would forgive me my Sins or I should not have had such a pleasant dream: I soon forgot to whom I was to look for preservation, &amp; got into a very Self working Strain for some time. In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year was marr<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> to my present Husband, in this new State I was more Introduc'd to Company &amp; Pleasure, but still kept Self-righteousness very close to me; but at length I grew that I could mix -Religion &amp; the pleasures of the World together. I had a very tender and Affectionate Husband, &amp; I went on in my unhappy State very easy for about 4 Years. (after I was marry'd  married) about w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I went to hear the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> now &amp; then, &amp; I soon began to Wish to be in some connexion with them, wch was granted me, my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> soon shewed me how filthy all my self righteousness appeared, &amp; that nothing but being washed in the blood of the Lamb would make me happy: The enemy of Man now began to Roar, &amp; great uneasiness <note type="catchword">arose</note></p>

				<p>arose on account of my leaving the Church; this was a time of great trial unto me: I saw I could not please God &amp; Mammon, &amp; our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> gave me the Grace to make choice of him, &amp; leave all other troubles to his direction. On Christmas Day 1781. I had the Grace to be rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; &amp; on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug: 1782. our dear Lord permitted me to be Spectator at the holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in London the first time, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> blessed time I shall never forget; Our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Presence was so near me, that he appeared to me as hanging in his crucified form before my Eyes; I never can thank &amp; adore him enough for his unbounded Love to me the chief of Sinners, who makes such small returns, &amp; proves so ungratefull for such boundless Love w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he bestows on me his poorest Creature: Soon after my return home from London I was taken ill, &amp; the Lamb that was Crucified - without the Gates of Jerusalem, that Friend of Sinners never withdrew his sweet nearness from me during my Confinement; at w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> his Body &amp; Blood in the holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for the first time on my Sick Bed to my Souls comfort: This memorial day was the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1782. Since w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I have had repeated Seals of his Love; O grant I may always remain as a poor Sinner at his Feet</p>
				<p>Thus far her own Account.</p>
				<p>In our late Sisters heavy Sickness which begun last October our Lord supported her in a very gracious manner, &amp; many of her Friends &amp; Acquaintance who had been much against her were now qu ite overcome, &amp; agreeably Struck with her sereene &amp; happy disposition of heart &amp; that Peace of God which was felt ruling in her heart; and the simple real &amp; unaffected Confession of what our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> is to a poor Creature who believes in him made a good Impression on many, and w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> we hope - will not be forgotten: When at times she was better she attended the Meetings dilligently, &amp; indeed often recover'd to our Surprize; was particularly thankfull for being able to attend the Meetings when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> La Trobe was here and to hear the Synod read, &amp; took it as a favour &amp; Gift from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; Was much concern'd for her two Children (the younger being deaf &amp; dumb) that</p>

				<p>they might be preserv'd for our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; &amp; her whole desire was that they might be under the Care of the Brethen, &amp; spoke fully thereon with her Husband &amp; Father.  In the last Period of her Sickness which last<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> about 3 Weeks, &amp; was very afflicting She had still to learn in the School of the H Ghost what a poor Creature she was, &amp; to be Stript of every thing but Jesus &amp; his Mood; About 14 Days before her departure when the extremity of Pain had brot her - almost to distraction, &amp; wherein the comfort from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was not so clear to her heart; She was <add place="above">afterwards</add> enabled to rejoice the more in the feeling of his gracious Presence &amp; Peace, and desired the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to thank our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for what he had done for Her, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was done with a gratefull Impression: The same Evening being again able to speak she sent for B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mortimer &amp; spoke very heartily with them, told them She had spoke fully with her Husband &amp; Father regarding the Children &amp;c. Was Sinner like &amp; loving &amp; our hearts tenderly united to thank our Lord for all Mercy bestow'd on her, &amp; that he would still graciously Accomplish all his Thoughts of Peace in her &amp; with her. On the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> which was her last she express'd her self very lovingly to all about her, and then said: O thou Lamb of God which takest away the Sin of the World thou hast also took away mine, &amp; wilt receive me bad as I am: Said to those about her He has taken away my hearing, but has given me my Speech to tell You he will receive me. She then said: Thou hast made my Bed soft, while thou diedst on the Ignominious Free; Thy Head was crown'd with Thorns Thy Back plow'd with deep Furrows &amp;c. We could perceive almost to her last, or as long as she was able to aim at speaking it was about the Sufferings &amp; death of our gracious Saviour: Her last moments were accompanied with our heart Prayers, beseeching our dear Lord to bless and to receive this his redeemed Soul; who now enter'd into his everlasting Rest in the 30th Year of this dying Life. </p></div>
