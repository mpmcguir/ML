						<lg>
							<l>Memoir of the Life of our late venerable &amp; </l>
							<l>happily departed Br Peter Jacob Planta, who </l>
							<l>entered into joy of his Lord, at Ockbrook, </l>
							<l>May the 6th 1815, in the 94th year of </l>
							<l>his age, written by himself.</l>
							<l>I was born at Jonkioping a town in</l>
							<l>Sweden, Dec.r the 5th, old stile in the</l>
							<l>year 1721. My Father's name was Jacob</l>
							<l>Planta &amp; my Mother's maiden name</l>
							<l>Martha Ruda. They were both of the</l>
							<l>Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters,</l>
							<l>the elder was born during my Mother's</l>
							<l>marriage to her first husband, whose</l>
							<l>name was Peter Hilling. Our Parents</l>
							<l>spared no pains in giving us a religious</l>
							<l>&amp; genteel education; we had morning</l>
							<l>&amp; evening prayers in the family, to</l>
							<l>which the servants were also admitted.</l>
							<l>My dear Mother would often read in</l>
							<l>the bible, &amp; after prayers, used to re</l>
							<l>late to us pleasing scriptural his</l>
							<l>tories, especially such as had a reference</l>
							<l>to the life, sufferings &amp; death of our</l>
							<l>dear Lord &amp; Saviour, &amp; also his conversations </l>

							<l>with his disciples &amp; some of the persecut</l>
							<l>tions which the latter had to endure for</l>
							<l>his sake. On such occasions I used to</l>
							<l>sit on her lap, &amp; sometimes asked what</l>
							<l>reward the disciples had for their faithful</l>
							<l>ness to our Saviour: to which she replied:</l>
							<l>"They are richly rewarded for they are now</l>
							<l>exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly</l>
							<l>kingdom, singing his praises, &amp; adoring</l>
							<l>him for ever! I said with tears, O my</l>
							<l>dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at</l>
							<l>the time our Saviour was upon earth,</l>
							<l>I also would have served him &amp; suffered</l>
							<l>for his sake. My Mother replied weeping,</l>
							<l>my dear child, if you had lived at that</l>
							<l>time you might perhaps have been of</l>
							<l>the number of those who cried out, cru</l>
							<l>cify him! crucify him! I said, O no, I never</l>
							<l>would, but I should have loved him dearly.</l>
							<l>She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to</l>
							<l>keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve</l>
							<l>me throughout my future life from sin,</l>
							<l>&amp; the seductions of this evil world, until</l>
							<l>I should be with him in his heavenly</l>
							<l>kingdom, &amp; then added that all those who</l>
							<l>loved &amp; served him here, would share</l>
							<l>in the same blessings which his disciples</l>
							<l>did. - This made a deep impression on my</l>
							<l>mind, &amp; was the first time when I </l>

							<l>but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp;</l>
							<l>attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour,</l>
							<l>&amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I</l>
							<l>might become &amp; remain a true child of</l>
							<l>God. When I was about 4 years of age,</l>
							<l>I experienced a remarkable preservation</l>
							<l>of my life. Having ran out of the house</l>
							<l>unobserved, with a spoon in my hand, I</l>
							<l>came to Lake Wetter, which was not</l>
							<l>far distant from our house, &amp; there</l>
							<l>being a broad plank laid over the water,</l>
							<l>I got to the end of it, &amp; was sitting on</l>
							<l>it, playing with the water, &amp; throwing</l>
							<l>it up with the spoon, admiring the </l>
							<l>drops which appeared to me like pearls.</l>
							<l>A woman who came to fetch water, called</l>
							<l>out to me to take care that I did not fall</l>
							<l>into the water, to whom I replied: I will</l>
							<l>not fall in, but she had scarcely returned</l>
							<l>to her house before she thought that she</l>
							<l>heard a plunge in the water, upon</l>
							<l>which she set down her pail, &amp; ran</l>
							<l>towards the lake. Perceiving me in</l>
							<l>the water, she ventured in, &amp; with difficul</l>
							<l>ty caught hold of me by the hair of my</l>
							<l>head, &amp; drawing me out, she laid me</l>
							<l>across the plank, believing me to be</l>
							<l>dead. She then carried me home to my</l>
							<l>Parents, who, with the whole family were </l>

						<lg>
							<l>greatly alarmed, &amp; exceeding distressed, as they</l>
							<l>could perceived no signs of life in me. I</l>
							<l>was however put into a warm bed, &amp; after</l>
							<l>some time, while they were lamenting over</l>
							<l>me, I came to myself &amp; said dear Mamma</l>
							<l>don't cry for me, I am here, &amp; to the great</l>
							<l>joy of the whole family I recovered. As</l>
							<l>I increased in years, I experienced several</l>
							<l>preservations of my life, having been</l>
							<l>in danger of losing it, both by fire &amp; water</l>
							<l>&amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents</l>
							<l>being desirous to give me a good education,</l>
							<l>procured a private Tutor in the house,</l>
							<l>until I went to a large school, in which</l>
							<l>I continued till my Father's happy depar</l>
							<l>ture, which took place in my 10th year.</l>
							<l>My Mother's intention was that I should</l>
							<l>continue my studies, wishing me to be</l>
							<l>a Minister of the Gospel, which also accord</l>
							<l>ed with my inclination. However a</l>
							<l>Relation persuaded my Mother to put</l>
							<l>me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon</l>
							<l>&amp; Apothecary in Gothenburg. Here I had</l>
							<l>a favorable opportunity to learn Pharmacy</l>
							<l>&amp; Chemistry, &amp; as my master had very</l>
							<l>extensive practice, &amp; employed me to</l>
							<l>visit his patients, I gradually began</l>
							<l>to practice myself. &amp; gave considerable</l>
							<l>satisfaction to my employer.</l>

							<l>my lost condition, I was for several years</l>
							<l>much concerned for my salvation, yea I may</l>
							<l>say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost</l>
							<l>carried on his work in my heart, by which </l>
							<l>I was prevented from many sinful things, altho'</l>
							<l>I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning</l>
							<l>alternately, so that when I would do good, evil</l>
							<l>was present with me. I felt frequently a</l>
							<l>great desire to separate myself from the</l>
							<l>world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I</l>
							<l>could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour,</l>
							<l>in which I took great delight. At such</l>
							<l>times I felt much pleasure in singing,</l>
							<l>praises &amp; thanksgiving God; &amp; nothing</l>
							<l>afforded me greater joy, than to thank our</l>
							<l>Saviour for the many preservations I had</l>
							<l>experienced from him, when in danger of</l>
							<l>my life. However I also, alas! often forgot</l>
							<l>myself, &amp; gave way to levity when play</l>
							<l>ing with my companions. But the good</l>
							<l>spirit of God frequently reminded me </l>
							<l>to seek the One thing needful. I felt a</l>
							<l>strong desire to be a child of God, &amp;</l>
							<l>when I was invited with my Parents</l>
							<l>to entertainments, at which was music</l>
							<l>&amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great un</l>
							<l>easiness, &amp;, like one who is sick, not</l>
							<l>understanding properly the accusations</l>
							<l>of my conscience. When I was about 13</l>
							<l>years of age I had a great desire to </l>
							<l>enjoy the Holy Comn, for which purpose </l>

							<l>I underwent an examination, &amp; was encouraged</l>
							<l>to partake. The first time I had the favor to</l>
							<l>approach the table of the Lord, it was with</l>
							<l>fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive it</l>
							<l>unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this divine</l>
							<l>repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more</l>
							<l>so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst</l>
							<l>the Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart,</l>
							<l>I frequently examined myself, fearing I was</l>
							<l>not yet a child of God, &amp; yet earnestly</l>
							<l>desiring to be one. Such was the state of</l>
							<l>my mind when I came to Gothenburg. I</l>
							<l>experienced, at first much attention from the</l>
							<l>family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so</l>
							<l>long as I conformed to every thing in it. How</l>
							<l>ever the great concern I had for my salvation</l>
							<l>&amp; the thought of not being a child of God, gave</l>
							<l>me much uneasiness. I was always glad</l>
							<l>whenever I could be alone, &amp; pour out the desire</l>
							<l>of my heart before God, &amp; frequently prayed</l>
							<l>in stillness to him. I also resolved to with</l>
							<l>draw from all worldly amusements &amp; to</l>
							<l>spend the little time I had to myself, in</l>
							<l>spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that</l>
							<l>I was a child of God. Sometimes I</l>
							<l>arose in cold frosty nights, prostrating</l>
							<l>myself before God, &amp; praying most fer</l>
							<l>vently unto him, but it afforded me</l>
							<l>no relief. I thought then that my</l>
							<l>sorrow for my sins was not yet great </l>

							<l>enough &amp; often repeated the 10 Command</l>
							<l>ments, in order to see &amp; feel my deviations</l>
							<l>&amp; sins, but as I could not cry &amp; weep like</l>
							<l>David, who all the night made his bed to</l>
							<l>swim, &amp; watered his couch with his tears,</l>
							<l>I thought my grief was not intense enough.</l>
							<l>But all my endeavours were in vain, because</l>
							<l>I erred, in supposing that if I could but weep</l>
							<l>much over my sins &amp; repent of them, then</l>
							<l>the Lord would receive me as his child, &amp; com</l>
							<l>fort me. I was convinced of the all sufficiency</l>
							<l>of our Lord &amp; Saviour, suffering for sinners,</l>
							<l>but thought I must be thus qualified before</l>
							<l>I could receive this blessing. I became now</l>
							<l>very zealous, frequently reproving others for sin,</l>
							<l>&amp; my singular conduct brought on me much</l>
							<l>persecution &amp; hatred, which however I</l>
							<l>gladly suffered, bearing all with patience</l>
							<l>&amp; never resenting any ill treatment, but</l>
							<l>on the contrary did such persons all the</l>
							<l>service I could, &amp; whenever opportunities</l>
							<l>offered, spoke to them concerning our Saviour.</l>
							<l>Two persons in the family where I lodged</l>
							<l>being awakened to a sense of their lost</l>
							<l>condition, one of them caused me much</l>
							<l>trouble &amp; uneasiness, on account of his</l>
							<l>fears &amp; unbelief, thinking he could not be</l>
							<l>forgiven. He fell at last into a</l>
							<l>melancholy, frequently hiding himself, </l>

							<l>&amp; even attempted to take away his life so that</l>
							<l>he appeared in a state of mental derangement.</l>
							<l>I used my utmost endeavours to nurture him,</l>
							<l>fearing that in case he should commit suicide</l>
							<l>a great dishonor would be brought on the gospel.</l>
							<l>with</l>
							<l>One time he sent me a message his last fare</l>
							<l>well, having locked himself up with a view to</l>
							<l>self-destruction. This caused me unspeak</l>
							<l>able distress, &amp; tho' I was at that time en</l>
							<l>gaged in very urgent business, &amp; in company</l>
							<l>with several persons, yet I took the key of</l>
							<l>the cellar, ran down &amp; locked the door, &amp;</l>
							<l>kneeling down by a hogshead of turpentine, I wept</l>
							<l>&amp; prayed most fervently to our Saviour, (with</l>
							<l>great confidence), that he would preserve the poor</l>
							<l>man's life, &amp; it seemed to me as if I heard</l>
							<l>a voice saying - Be comforted, no evil shall</l>
							<l>hurt him. This I believed, &amp; arose, giving</l>
							<l>thanks to God my Saviour, &amp; returned cheerful</l>
							<l>ly to my business, till about 12 o'clock at night,</l>
							<l>being uneasy in my mind, I removed some</l>
							<l>boards &amp; other things, when I found him alive</l>
							<l>&amp; feeling thankful to God for his preservation,</l>
							<l>executed</l>
							<l>I asked him why he had not performed his</l>
							<l>intention, to which he replied, that when he</l>
							<l>was about to attempt it, he fell, &amp; all his</l>
							<l>strength was taken from him, so that he</l>
							<l>could neither move a limb, nor speak</l>
							<l>a word, till I came. I spoke comfortably</l>
							<l>to him, encouraging him to take his</l>
							<l>refuge to our Saviour &amp; conducting him</l>
							<l>to his room, I prayed with him, &amp; in the</l>
							<l>sequel he grew better. The other person</l>

							<l>who was awakened was the Cook, who</l>
							<l>died suddenly, but very happily. She had</l>
							<l>been much beloved by her Mistress, &amp;</l>
							<l>her Mistress' Mother, &amp; her sudden death</l>
							<l>caused the old Lady to swoon away. I was</l>
							<l>then, (altho I had been much despised &amp;</l>
							<l>derided on account of religion,) called upon</l>
							<l>to speak comfort to the old lady, &amp; as soon</l>
							<l>as she recovered, she took me by the hand</l>
							<l>&amp; begged my pardon, adding: "I have been </l>
							<l>the cause of the persecution you have suffered."</l>
							<l>I replied, 'I have no occasion to forgive you,</l>
							<l>for you have done me more good than harm, since</l>
							<l>it has caused me to cleave closer to my Sa</l>
							<l>viour, who will hear the prayers of all repent</l>
							<l>ing sinners. Thus her hatred &amp; persecution were</l>
							<l>turned into great love &amp; kindness. About</l>
							<l>this time I attended the preaching of the</l>
							<l>Revd Mr Lindberg in Gothenburg. He observed</l>
							<l>in his sermon, that there were several kinds</l>
							<l>of people, who were hindered from enjoying</l>
							<l>the happiness which the Lord would willingly</l>
							<l>bestow upon them, if they would but come in</l>
							<l>the way &amp; order of his appointment. Among</l>
							<l>one of these sorts of well meaning souls, I</l>
							<l>found myself so completely described as if I</l>
							<l>had opened my whole mind to him. He</l>
							<l>remarked that some people thought that if </l>
							<l>they could arrive at a certain degree of ex</l>
							<l>cessive grief &amp; anguish, &amp; could shed repenting</l>
							<l>tears night &amp; day, that then the Lord </l>

							<l>would have mercy upon them, forgive them</l>
							<l>all their sins, &amp; be gracious unto them. But,</l>
							<l>said he, this is worth nothing, for nothing is </l>
							<l>meritorious on our part. Nothing but alone</l>
							<l>the meritorious holy life, bitter sufferings, bleeding</l>
							<l>&amp; dying of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ,</l>
							<l>his being wounded for our transgressions, &amp; his</l>
							<l>sorrows &amp; anguish until death, this alone</l>
							<l>meritorious, &amp; whoever can believe this,</l>
							<l>will obtain mercy &amp; forgiveness of all his sins.</l>
							<l>He added - My dear Friend, whoever thou art</l>
							<l>&amp; wherever thou art standing or seated in this</l>
							<l>place - Come with me, &amp; let us mount up</l>
							<l>by faith to Mount Calvary, &amp; behold the</l>
							<l>Cross of Christ, the suffering Lamb of God,</l>
							<l>view his wounds, his thorny crown, &amp; all his</l>
							<l>torments by faith. It was then, that with</l>
							<l>a happy astonishment I truly beheld, as</l>
							<l>for me, my Saviour bowing his head,</l>
							<l>&amp; giving up his spirit into the hands of</l>
							<l>his dear heavenly Father, &amp; in that mo</l>
							<l>ment all my uneasiness &amp; heaviness,</l>
							<l>which had tormented my conscience</l>
							<l>forsook me, &amp; I was filled with such</l>
							<l>joy &amp; happiness, as not to be able to </l>
							<l>describe it, &amp; I heard no more what</l>
							<l>the Preacher said, but rejoiced in stillness,</l>
							<l>thanking my dear Saviour, being fully</l>
							<l>assured that he had forgiven me all</l>

							<l>Gratitude &amp; entering my chamber, I </l>
							<l>Locked the door, fell prostrate before him,</l>
							<l>&amp; offered him the sacrifice of thanksgiving.</l>
							<l>I felt as new born, but this lasted only a</l>
							<l>day &amp; a half, when a person treated me ill,</l>
							<l>with</l>
							<l>Which caused anger to arise in my breast,</l>
							<l>altho’ I did not reply one word, yet it caused </l>
							<l>lose </l>
							<l>me to lose this impression of happiness, &amp;</l>
							<l>plunged me into distress, so that I could</l>
							<l>not rest, fearing I had lost the grace</l>
							<l>bestowed upon me, &amp; should be lost. I called</l>
							<l>upon a Minister, to whom I opened my mind,</l>
							<l>&amp; informed him of my situation &amp; grief. He</l>
							<l>comforted me with these words: “My dear friend,</l>
							<l>the Apostle Peter once asked the Lord Jesus,</l>
							<l>how often he should forgive his brother? Till</l>
							<l>seven times?” To which our Lord replied:</l>
							<l>I say not unto thee until 7 times, but</l>
							<l>until 70 times 7. Now if our good Lord, </l>
							<l>commanded a sinful man to forgive his </l>
							<l>brother so often, what must not he himself </l>
							<l>do, when a poor sinner repents, &amp; prays </l>
							<l>to him for forgiveness, since he is the foun</l>
							<l>tain of all goodness, grace &amp; mercy!” I asked </l>
							<l>him if I might pray to our Saviour to</l>
							<l>forgive me? to which he replied:</l>
							<l>certainly, for as often as we fall we </l>
							<l>must rise &amp; go to our merciful</l>
							<l>Saviour, who will in no wise cast out</l>
							<l>those who come to him. I asked </l>

							<l>&amp; may I go to him whenever I want com</l>
							<l>fort? to which he answered, By all</l>
							<l>means. This proved a great comfort to</l>
							<l>me &amp; it caused me to feel quite happy,</l>
							<l>because our Lord would be so gracious</l>
							<l>I followed his advice &amp; found comfort. Feeling</l>
							<l>myself one time exceeding unworthy, so that</l>
							<l>I durst not venture to go to the Holy Comn</l>
							<l>I called upon a pious Clergyman to whom </l>
							<l>I opened my whole mind. He comforted me</l>
							<l>by saying: My dear Friend, even such as you</l>
							<l>are, the Lord Jesus calls to come, for he</l>
							<l>says: "Come until me all ye that labor &amp;</l>
							<l>are heavy laden &amp; I will give you rest;</l>
							<l>take my yoke upon you &amp; learn of me</l>
							<l>for I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, &amp; ye</l>
							<l>shall find rest unto your souls. He</l>
							<l>admonished me not to absent myself,</l>
							<l>adding that he intended the following Sunday</l>
							<l>to partake of the H. Comn himself &amp;</l>
							<l>that if I would attend, the Lord would</l>
							<l>certainly bless &amp; comfort me. Hereupon</l>
							<l>I ventured with trembling, &amp; during the</l>
							<l>participation experienced inexpressible joy</l>
							<l>&amp; comfort. During the time when I ex</l>
							<l>endured</l>
							<l>perienced much persecution, I felt a </l>
							<l>great desire to become acquainted with</l>
							<l>a genuine child of God, if there were</l>

							<l>rejoiced, thinking this a suitable place, in which</l>
							<l>I could pour out my whole soul before the Lord,</l>
							<l>unobserved as I thought by any one. I em</l>
							<l>braced this opportunity with gratitude, &amp;</l>
							<l>kneeling down, prayed with fervor to our Saviour,</l>
							<l>mentioning to him all my concerns, intreating</l>
							<l>him with great earnestness, if there was any</l>
							<l>genuine child of God in the world, he would</l>
							<l>bring him to me, or me to him, in order </l>
							<l>that we might become acquainted, during</l>
							<l>which prayer I felt richly comforted with</l>
							<l>his divine presence. Whilst I was at prayer,</l>

							<l>came softly &amp; unperceived by me, to the</l>

							<l>awakened in Gottenburg who were so near to</l>

							<l>knew how to make a better use of it; for</l>

							<l>to visit me occasionally, &amp; one Sunday called</l>
							<l>a little before service time, on purpose</l>
							<l>that he might be with me alone. When</l>

							<l>My Friend, I believe you to be a person</l>
							<l>who loves our Saviour, &amp; I am another,</l>
							<l>would it not be well if we were better</l>

							<l>Yes. I said: then the Lord has heard my</l>
							<l>prayers. I rejoiced exceedingly, fell about</l>

							<l>I was not on the road, altho' it appeared to me</l>
							<l>like a public path. When the Gentleman</l>
							<l>came up to me, he immediately pulled off</l>
							<l>my cloak, &amp; gave it in anger to his servant,</l>
							<l>adding who gave you leave to walk here?</l>
							<l>I replied humbly that I had not known I</l>
							<l>was trespassing, &amp; begged pardon, while at </l>
							<l>the same time I unbuttoned my coat, with</l>
							<l>a view to give him that also, calling to</l>
							<l>mind our Saviour's words: Him that</l>
							<l>taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take</l>
							<l>thy coat also; upon which his anger sub</l>
							<l>sided. I then asked permission to return,</l>
							<l>but he said, As you have come so far you</l>
							<l>may proceed. He refused however to take</l>
							<l>my coat, but kept my cloak, upon which</l>
							<l>we parted. When I arrived at the garden</l>

							<l>asked the cause of my weeping? I re</l>

							<l>that all these persons are children of</l>

							<l>not have believed there were so many</l>

							<l>Having entered the house &amp; standing at</l>
							<l>the door, I asked with surprise, if all</l>
							<l>present were children of God, which</l>
							<l>was answered in a friendly manner in</l>

							<l>then I am not worthy to be among you.</l>
							<l>However they asked me to sit down &amp; they</l>
							<l>would communicate some written accounts</l>

							<l>London. The 23d early, our ship's crew</l>
							<l>attempted to seize a boat, &amp; leave the</l>
							<l>vessel, the mate having offended them, &amp;</l>
							<l>alledging they were too few in number to</l>
							<l>navigate the vessel, however the Captain</l>
							<l>restored order, &amp; procured several addition</l>
							<l>al hands on board; about 11p.m. we pro</l>
							<l>ceeded with a favorable breeze, but the</l>
							<l>following day, the weather becoming boister</l>
							<l>ous, we grew very sick. During the</l>
							<l>night, 2 ships ran foul of each other,</l>
							<l>&amp; one of them received considerable damage,</l>
							<l>&amp; was obliged to put back. The 25th</l>
							<l>we were becalmed, but the following day </l>
							<l>the wind rose very high, however I recovered</l>
							<l>so far that I could keep out of bed, for</l>
							<l>which I was very thankful. The 30th</l>
							<l>we were driven to the Irish coast; &amp;</l>
							<l>entered the harbor of Kinsale, where</l>
							<l>we went on shore, &amp; as our Captain</l>
							<l>apprehended we should have a tedious</l>
							<l>passage, he advised us to lay in more</l>
							<l>provisions. My wife &amp; I therefore went to</l>
							<l>a shop to purchase what was needful.</l>
							<l>The Master &amp; Mistress who were elderly</l>
							<l>people, inquired if we had come with</l>
							<l>the fleet from London, to which we</l>
							<l>replied that we had. They Said : May</l>
							<l>God forbid! I asked why? They added,</l>
							<l>we appeared very unsuitable for Jamai</l>

							<l>as they had many friends in the Town who</l>
							<l>would be glad to employ me, I should soon</l>

							<l>send us free of expense thither in one of</l>
							<l>of their own vessels, which would sail in</l>
							<l>a few days Thanking them for their</l>
							<l>kindness to strangers, as we were to</l>
							<l>them, we replied that it was our in</l>
							<l>tention to proceed. They asked, what could</l>
							<l>induce us to proceed in such a step? I</l>
							<l>added, that altho' I might probably</l>
							<l>practice physic &amp; surgery in that</l>
							<l>Island, yet my chief design was, to preach</l>
							<l>the gospel to the Negro slaves &amp; endeavour to be</l>
							<l>instrumental in turning them from darkness to</l>
							<l>light, &amp; from the power of Satan unto God</l>
							<l>their Saviour. They replied Then go in</l>
							<l>the name of God, for this is a good work, &amp;</l>
							<l>we should be sorry to hinder it.</l>
							<l>April 18, we got sight of Jamaica,</l>

							<l>In this Island our late Brother served</l>
							<l>both in his medicinal capacity, &amp; in the </l>
							<l>Mission, as a devoted servant of the Lord,</l>
							<l>spending his time &amp; talents for that Saviour,</l>
							<l>whom he truly loved, &amp; in whom he had found </l>
							<l>pardon, peace &amp; eternal life. In those </l>
							<l>Diaries which he kept during his abode</l>
							<l>in that Island, it appears that he was</l>
							<l>earnestly solicitous to promote the happiness</l>
							<l>of those souls committed to his care, &amp; that</l>
							<l>during his services there, he endured not </l>
							<l>only many hardships, but also escaped</l>
							<l>many dangers, but it was apparent that</l>
							<l>none of these things moved him, neither</l>
							<l>counted he his life dear unto himself,</l>
							<l>so that he might finish his course</l>
							<l>with joy, &amp; the ministry which he had</l>
							<l>received of the Lord Jesus Christ, to testi</l>
							<l>fy the gospel of the grace of God. A few </l>
							<l>extracts out of his diaries will suffice</l>
							<l>to show his state of heart &amp; mind. He</l>
							<l>writes thus: “By degrees I got also my </l>
							<l>choice of sufferings, but which, in due</l>
							<l>times my Saviour terminated, &amp; which </l>
							<l>he enabled me to bear with patience.</l>
							<l>They had a salutory effect upon my soul</l>
							<l>It was a delight to me to serve my </l>

							<l>always comforted me where I met with</l>

							<l>times, &amp; in such a manner, that I </l>
							<l>cannot recollect even once to have refrined</l>
							<l>at my situation.</l>
							<l>In the time of Rebellion among the </l>

							<l>defence with me when I rode out, altho </l>
							<l>advised by many to do so, &amp; yet I always </l>
							<l>escaped unhurt to my own astonishment, </l>
							<l>I generally replied to such advice, I trust </l>

							<l>was not aware of the great danger to</l>

							<l>A number of soldiers who were just exercising</l>

							<l>them that I had seen none, they could</l>
							<l>scarcely believe me, declaring they had seen</l>

							<l>Another time I arrived at an old building</l>
							<l>which had been uninhabited for many</l>

							<l>he stretched forth his arms in a most af</l>
